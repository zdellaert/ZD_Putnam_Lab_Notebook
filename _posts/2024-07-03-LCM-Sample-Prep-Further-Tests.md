## Fixing and decalcifying Pocillopora and Porites tissue for LCM, to further improve sectioning and extractions

### Protocol [here](https://zdellaert.github.io/ZD_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/PAXgene-Fix-Decalc-Protocol/)

1. Day 1 (7/3/24): Fixed tissue in PAXgene fixative (*Pocillopora* and *Porites compressa* (frag Test3) from CBLS Wetlab)
   1. Relax colony in 3 % w/volume magnesium chloride 
      1. To make solution, filter seawater from CBLS wetlab through a 0.2 um filter. Transfer to clean and labelled screwtop glass bottle.
         1. ![FSW_2.jpeg](https://github.com/zdellaert/ZD_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/images/protocols/PAXgene_fix/FSW_2.jpeg?raw=true)
         2. ![FSW.jpeg](https://github.com/zdellaert/ZD_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/images/protocols/PAXgene_fix/FSW.jpeg?raw=true)
      2. Add 3 g MgCl2 to each 100 mL of seawater
      3. Warm bottle to tank temperature for ~30 mins.
      4. Fill a 200 mL beakers with solution and transfer one fragment per beaker to try to relax the tissue
         1. this honestly does not look like it is working as we intend. We want the polyps to stick out but they contract after a few minutes in sthe solution anyways...
            1. ![relax.jpeg](https://github.com/zdellaert/ZD_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/images/protocols/PAXgene_fix/relax.jpeg?raw=true)
   2. Then cut off branches and transfer gently to PAXgene fixative for 24 hours in fume hood, room temp
      1. Porites: cut off 3 branches and put into fresh PAXgene tissue container (10 mL removed for POC below)
      2. Pocillopora: put 2 branches each in a 5 mL tube with 5 mL PAXgene fixative each
   3. 
2. Day 2 (7/4/24): Replace fixative with stabilizer, transfer to 4 ÂºC
3.
