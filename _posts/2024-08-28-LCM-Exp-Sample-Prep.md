## Fixing and decalcifying Pocillopora for LCM Experiment

### Protocol [here](https://zdellaert.github.io/ZD_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/PAXgene-Fix-Decalc-Protocol/)

1. Day 1 (8/28/24): Fixed tissue in PAXgene fixative (*Pocillopora* from CBLS Wetlab)
   1. Selected 5 plugs from crate 14, labelled A-E. Took photos with size standard of each.
   2. ![Pretty_Frags.png](https://github.com/zdellaert/ZD_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/images/LCM_Pilot_Fixing/Pretty_Frags.png?raw=true)
   3. ![Frags_label_Size.png](https://github.com/zdellaert/ZD_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/images/LCM_Pilot_Fixing/Frags_label_Size.png?raw=true)
   4. Then cut off branches and transfer gently to PAXgene fixative for 24 hours in fume hood, room temp
      1. First frag fixed at 16:42, last at 15:12 (so all within 20 minutes)
      2. 2 branches each in a 5 mL tube with 5 mL PAXgene fixative each
   5. Environmental conditions:
      1. Temp: 26.38 ºC
      2. pH: -73.2 mv (8.1)
      3. Salinity: 35.14 psu
2. Day 2 (8/29/24): Replace fixative with stabilizer, transfer to 4 ºC
3. Day 3 (Fri 8/30/24): Started decalcification, kept on shaker in cold room (4 ºC)
   1. First wash with ICE-COLD Rnase-free PBS to remove excess ethanol, then transfer to sterilized and RNA-se cleaned beaker or tube with ICE-COLD EDTA and put in cold room at 4 ºC.
4. Day 4 (Sat 8/31/24): Changed EDTA solution (24 h)
5. Day 5 (Sun 9/1/24): Still not decalcified, had to change the solution again. Moved to 6-well plate (48 h)
6. Day 6 (Mon 9/2/24): Still not decalcified, had to change the solution again. (72 h)
7. Day 7 (Tues 9/3/24): Morining: Transfer into 10 mL of 15% RNAse-free sucrose at 4 ºC in RNAse-free PBS until the tissue sinks
   1. Then into 30 % sucrose in RNAse-free PBS until tissue sinks --> then embed and store at -80 overnight
   2. Decalcification went from 5pm 8/30 to 8am 9/3 - about 87 hours.

### Embedding Protocol [here](https://zdellaert.github.io/ZD_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/Cryoembedding-Protocol/)

1. Day 7 (9/3/24): Embed on powdered dry ice and store at -80 ºC until sectioning
   1. Make sure to cool forceps on dry ice and OCT to 4ºC
   2. Make sure to fully dry tissue before embedding
   3. :et tissue sit in OCT for 2 minutes before freezing, to let it fully soak in
   4. Tightly wrapped in aluminum foil cleaned with Ethanol and RNAse away, then put in whirlpak and stored at - 80 ºC in a plastic box. 
      1. Two branches per frag
   5. Cryomold, alumnium foil labelled with frag number, two wrapped molds per one labelled whirlpak per frag.

### Sectioning and performing LCM on these branches, using the same steps outlined in [this July post](https://github.com/zdellaert/ZD_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/_posts/2024-07-18-LCM-Test-4.md)

Current timeline plan (will very likely need to change)
1. 9/4/24: Sectioning, LCM, and extraction on Frag A (if time)
2. 9/5/24: Sectioning on Frags B&C
3. 9/6/24: LCM on Frags B&C; extraction if time
4. 9/10/24: Sectioning on Frags D&E
3. 9/11/24: LCM on Frags D&E; extraction if time

Modifying sectioning protocol to fix tissue to slides immediately after sectioning, following the PAXgene suggestions [here](https://github.com/zdellaert/ZD_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/protocols/HB-1543-S01-001_PX20_SP_TIssue_System_Preparation_of_sections_from_PFPE_and_PFCE_tissues_for_manual_or_LMD_1015_WW.pdf)

***Modified Cresyl violet staining solution*** (from [here](https://github.com/zdellaert/ZD_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/protocols/leicalmdprotocolguide-May-2015.pdf))
1. Prepare Cresyl violet staining solution at least one week prior usage
2. Add 0.5 g Cresyl violet into 50 ml 100% ethanol
3. Mix solution and store at 4°C sealed air-tight and dark
   1. mixed on orbital shaker overnight in cold room, with occasional vigorous shaking to resuspend powder into solution

#### Sectioning: 9/4/24
4.  [Section](https://zdellaert.github.io/ZD_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/Cryosectioning-Protocol/) onto PEN membrane slide for LCM as well as extra slides for confocal morpholgy imaging and backup for RNA and DNA extraction
   1. **All surfaces and equipment should be treated with RNAse cleaner!!!**
   2. Morning of: prepare PEN slide with UV and RNAse cleaner
      1. Make sure to not damage or touch the membrane in any way
      2. Using sterilized and RNAse zap-ped forceps, dip slides in RNAse zap for 15 seconds
      3. Follow this by two 15 second rinses in DEPC water
      4. Let dry, at room temperature or at 37 ºC
      5. When visibly dry, place in UV box for 30 minutes (ideally do so immediately prior to sectioning)
      6. With clean, gloved hands, transfer to slide box for sectioning
   3. Prepare solutions:
      1. 70% Ethanol, 2 containers
      2. 100% Ethanol 
   4. **Sectioning procedure:**
      1. Keep slide cold in the cryostat, briefly warm sections with finger to adhere
      2. Air-dry the slide for 1 min at room temperature (15–25°C).
      3. 70% Ethanol, 1 minute (**some protocols say 2 min**)
      4. Transfer the slide to ice-cold 100% ethanol for transport to lab
   5. **In lab: Staining Procedure** (modified/combined from [here](https://github.com/zdellaert/ZD_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/protocols/leicalmdprotocolguide-May-2015.pdf) and [here](https://github.com/zdellaert/ZD_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/protocols/Zeiss-RNA-extraction-frozen-sections.pdf) to reduce exposure to aqueous solutions of lower than 70% ethanol to reduce RNAses) ([ALSO](https://www.olivelab.org/uploads/6/3/6/2/6362060/laser_capture_microdissection_on_frozen_sections_for_extraction_of_high-quality_nucleic_acids.pdf))
      1. **ALL SOLUTIONS ICE COLD**
         1. Place slide on petri dish
         2. Apply Cresyl violet staining solution (in 100% ethanol) directly with syringe and sterile filter to the section and incubate for 1 minute, swivel gently
         3. Dip for 5 seconds in 70% ethanol (dip several times to remove all OCT) 
            1. Repeat with fresh container of 70% ethanol
            2. **may need to dunk slide in RNAse-free H2O to remove all OCT. If so it needs to be very quick and ice cold and then immedately dunked in cold ethanol again.**
         4. Dip for 5 seconds in 100% ethanol (dip a few times) 
            1. Can fix up to 2 minutes in 100% ethanol or even for short-term storage prior to LCM
         5. Air dry sample 1-2 in drying chamber with desiccant or fume hood
            1. **if possible, proceed to immediate LCM at this step!**
   6. Freeze slides at -80 ºC

#### LCM: 
1. Buffers to collect cells in, bring to LCM and fill tube caps with 40 uL of solution when loading onto scope:
   1. Zymo Proteinase K digestion buffer (190 uL) + proteinase K (10 uL)
   2. Charm DD1 frozen tissue buffer
