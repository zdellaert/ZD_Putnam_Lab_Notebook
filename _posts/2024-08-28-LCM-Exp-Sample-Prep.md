## Fixing and decalcifying Pocillopora for LCM Experiment

### Protocol [here](https://zdellaert.github.io/ZD_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/PAXgene-Fix-Decalc-Protocol/)

1. Day 1 (8/28/24): Fixed tissue in PAXgene fixative (*Pocillopora* from CBLS Wetlab)
   1. Selected 5 plugs from crate 14, labelled A-E. Took photos with size standard of each.
   2. ![Pretty_Frags.png](https://github.com/zdellaert/ZD_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/images/LCM_Pilot_Fixing/Pretty_Frags.png?raw=true)
   3. ![Frags_label_Size.png](https://github.com/zdellaert/ZD_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/images/LCM_Pilot_Fixing/Frags_label_Size.png?raw=true)
   4. Then cut off branches and transfer gently to PAXgene fixative for 24 hours in fume hood, room temp
      1. First frag fixed at 16:42, last at 15:12 (so all within 20 minutes)
      2. 2 branches each in a 5 mL tube with 5 mL PAXgene fixative each
2. Day 2 (8/29/24): Replace fixative with stabilizer, transfer to 4 ºC
3. Day 3 (Fri 8/30/24): Started decalcification, kept on shaker in cold room (4 ºC)
   1. First wash with ICE-COLD Rnase-free PBS to remove excess ethanol, then transfer to sterilized and RNA-se cleaned beaker or tube with ICE-COLD EDTA and put in cold room at 4 ºC.

4. Day 4 (Sat 8/31/24): Changed EDTA solution
5. Day 5 (Sun 9/1/24), Transfer into 10 mL of 15% RNAse-free sucrose at 4 ºC in RNAse-free PBS until the tissue sinks
   1. Then into 30 % sucrose in RNAse-free PBS at 4 ºC overnight or until tissue sinks

### Embedding Protocol [here](https://zdellaert.github.io/ZD_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/Cryoembedding-Protocol/)

1. Day 6 (9/2/24): Embed on powdered dry ice and store at -80 ºC until sectioning
   1. In cold room?
   2. Make sure to cool forceps on dry ice and OCT to 4ºC
   3. Make sure to fully dry tissue before embedding
   4. Possibly let tissue sit in OCT for 10 minutes at 4ºC before freezing, to let it fully soak in
   5. Tightly wrapped in aluminum foil cleaned with Ethanol and RNAse away, then put in whirlpak and stored at - 80 ºC in a plastic box. 
      1. Two branches per frag
   6. How to effectively label these?
