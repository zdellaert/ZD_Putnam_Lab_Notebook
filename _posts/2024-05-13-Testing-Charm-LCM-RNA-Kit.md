## Testing Charm RNA Kit on LCM Samples

### [Protocol Link](https://zdellaert.github.io/ZD_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/Charm-LCM-RNA-Kit-Protocol/)

## 5/9/24 - Extracting RNA from LCM-captured cells (LCM date 5/8/24)

Used Charm Biotech Just-a-Tube ™ Laser Captured Microdissection (LCM)Sample Total RNA/MicroRNA Purification [Kit](https://www.charmbiotech.com/lcm-rna.htm), [protocol](https://github.com/zdellaert/ZD_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/protocols/Charm_Biotech_LCM_RNA_Kit.pdf)

### Sectioning performed on 5/6/24 and LCM on 5/9/24. See details [here](https://zdellaert.github.io/ZD_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/LCM-Sample-Prep/)

#### Protocol notes:

- Followed the Charm FFPE protocol almost exactly, but did all incubations at 56 ºC based on other Paxgene extraction protocols. Did a 3 hour incubation in the thermoblock.

#### Qubit Results

- Used High Sensitivity RNA Qubit [Protocol](https://zdellaert.github.io/ZD_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/Qubit-Protocol/)
- All samples read twice, standard only read once

 RNA Standards: 27.24 (S1) & 325.15 (S2)

| colony_id | RNA_QBIT_1 | RNA_QBIT_2 | RNA_QBIT_AVG |
|-----------|------------|------------|--------------|
| LCM sample #3   |  nd |  nd        |   nd         |
| LCM sample #10  |  nd |  nd        |   nd         |

#### RNA Quality Check: Tapestation

Basically nothing! Oh well.

## 5/13/24 - Attempt #2 of Extracting RNA from LCM-captured cells (LCM date 5/8/24)

#### Protocol notes:

- Followed the Charm FFPE protocol almost exactly, but did all incubations at 56 ºC based on other Paxgene extraction protocols. Did a 15 minute incubation in the incubator genie.

#### Qubit Results

- Used High Sensitivity RNA Qubit [Protocol](https://zdellaert.github.io/ZD_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/Qubit-Protocol/)
- All samples read twice, standard only read once

 RNA Standards: 27.80 (S1) & 310.89 (S2)

| colony_id | RNA_QBIT_1 | RNA_QBIT_2 | RNA_QBIT_AVG |
|-----------|------------|------------|--------------|
| LCM sample #2   |  nd |  nd        |   nd         |
| LCM sample #6  |  nd |  nd        |   nd         |

#### RNA Quality Check: Tapestation

Ran a high sensitivity RNA tapestation for the first time. Is this degraded DNA? Got RINs and concentrations but this doesn't look like RNA.

### Potential to use Carrier RNA?

"The PAXgene Tissue RNA Kit contains poly-A RNA for use as carrier RNA. When added to lysates from microdissected tissue, the carrier RNA may improve the recovery of total RNA. Carrier RNA is not required when processing more than 5000 cells. The small amounts of poly-A RNA used as carrier RNA do not interfere with subsequent RT-PCR, even when oligo-dT is used as a primer for reverse transcription. Reverse-transcription reactions typically contain an excess of oligo-dT primers, and the small amounts of poly-A used as carrier RNA are insignificant in comparison. Total RNA purified using poly-A RNA as carrier RNA can be amplified with the QIAGEN® QuantiTect® Whole Transcriptome Kit, which uses a mix of random and oligo-dT primers."
   - "When processing <5000 cells, carrier RNA may be added to the lysate (see “Carrier RNA”, page 2). Before using carrier RNA for the first time, dissolve it (310 μg) in 1 ml RNase-free water. Store this stock solution at –20°C and use it to make fresh dilutions for each set of RNA preparations. The concentration of this stock solution is 310 ng/μl. Prepare a working solution of 4 ng/μl using Buffer TR1"
