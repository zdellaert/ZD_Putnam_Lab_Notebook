## Fixing and decalcifying Pocillopora for LCM Pilot Experiment

### Protocol [here](https://zdellaert.github.io/ZD_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/PAXgene-Fix-Decalc-Protocol/)

1. Day 1 (8/28/24): Fixed tissue in PAXgene fixative (*Pocillopora* from CBLS Wetlab)
   1. Selected 5 plugs from crate 15, labelled A-E. Took photos with size standard of each.
   2. Then cut off branches and transfer gently to PAXgene fixative for 24 hours in fume hood, room temp
      1. Pocillopora: put 2 branches each in a 5 mL tube with 5 mL PAXgene fixative each
2. Day 2 (8/29/24): Replace fixative with stabilizer, transfer to 4 ºC
3. Day 3 (8/30/24): Started decalcification, kept on shaker in cold room (4 ºC)
   1. ![decalc.jpeg](image link)
4. Day 4 (8/31/24): Changed EDTA solution
5. Day 5 (9/1/24), Transfer into 10 mL of 15% RNAse-free sucrose at 4 ºC in RNAse-free PBS until the tissue sinks
   1. Then into 30 % sucrose in RNAse-free PBS at 4 ºC overnight or until tissue sinks
6. Day 7 (9/2/24): Embed on powdered dry ice and store at -80 ºC until sectioning
   1. Tightly wrapped in aluminum foil cleaned with Ethanol and RNAse away, then aluminum package wrapped tightly in ziplock and stored at - 80 ºC in a plastic box.
   2. How to effectively label these?
