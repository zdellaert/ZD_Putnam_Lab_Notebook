## Fixing and decalcifying Pocillopora for LCM Pilot Experiment

### Protocol [here](https://zdellaert.github.io/ZD_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/PAXgene-Fix-Decalc-Protocol/)

1. Day 1 (8/28/24): Fixed tissue in PAXgene fixative (*Pocillopora* and *Porites compressa* (frag Test3) from CBLS Wetlab)
   1. Relax colony in 3 % w/volume magnesium chloride 
      1. To make solution, filter seawater from CBLS wetlab through a 0.2 um filter. Transfer to clean and labelled screwtop glass bottle.
         1. ![FSW_2.jpeg](https://github.com/zdellaert/ZD_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/images/protocols/PAXgene_fix/FSW_2.jpeg?raw=true)
         2. ![FSW.jpeg](https://github.com/zdellaert/ZD_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/images/protocols/PAXgene_fix/FSW.jpeg?raw=true)
      2. Add 3 g MgCl2 to each 100 mL of seawater
      3. Warm bottle to tank temperature for ~30 mins.
      4. Fill a 200 mL beakers with solution and transfer one fragment per beaker to try to relax the tissue
         1. this honestly does not look like it is working as we intend. We want the polyps to stick out but they contract after a few minutes in sthe solution anyways...
            1. ![relax.jpeg](https://github.com/zdellaert/ZD_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/images/protocols/PAXgene_fix/relax.jpeg?raw=true)
   2. Then cut off branches and transfer gently to PAXgene fixative for 24 hours in fume hood, room temp
      1. Pocillopora: put 2 branches each in a 5 mL tube with 5 mL PAXgene fixative each
2. Day 2 (8/29/24): Replace fixative with stabilizer, transfer to 4 ºC
3. Day 3 (8/30/24): Started decalcification, kept on shaker in cold room (4 ºC)
   1. ![decalc.jpeg](image link)
4. Day 4 (8/31/24): Changed EDTA solution
5. Day 5 (9/1/24), Transfer into 10 mL of 15% RNAse-free sucrose at 4 ºC in RNAse-free PBS until the tissue sinks
   1. Then into 30 % sucrose in RNAse-free PBS at 4 ºC overnight or until tissue sinks
6. Day 7 (9/2/24): Embed on powdered dry ice and store at -80 ºC until sectioning
   1. Tightly wrapped in aluminum foil cleaned with Ethanol and RNAse away, then aluminum package wrapped tightly in ziplock and stored at - 80 ºC in a plastic box.
   2. How to effectively label these?
