## More info to come, just some quick notes

- slide prep notes:
  - may need to dunk slide in RNAse-free H2O to remove all OCT. If so it needs to be very quick and ice cold and then immedately dunked in cold ethanol again.

Buffers to collect cells in:

- Zymo Proteinase K digestion buffer (190 uL) + proteinase K (10 uL)
- Zymo RNA/DNA lysis buffer
- Zymo RNA lysis buffer
