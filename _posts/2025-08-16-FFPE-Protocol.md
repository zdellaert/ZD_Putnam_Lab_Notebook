### Equipment
1. Shaker/rotating plate in cold room or 4 ºC fridge
2. Fume hood
3. Drying oven for paraffin embedding
4. Flammable-safe refrigerator

## Procedure

### 1. Prepare 4% formalin in seawater
1. Filter seawater (in my case taken from the Putnam lab wetlab Blue Tanks) with a 0.2 uM filter into an autoclaved glass bottle
   1. I use a 30 mL syringe with an attached filter
   2. FSW hereforth means UV-sterilized filtered seawater
2. Close bottle tightly and UV sterilize for 30 minutes
3. *In fume hood with PPE*: Add 32.4 mL of formaldehyde to 267.6 mL FSW
4. Aliquot into 5mL tubes and store at 4ºC

### 2. Fixation
   1. *Wear PPE (lab coat, gloves, eye covering)*
   2. Clip live coral directly into 4 mL of formalin (5 mL tube)
   3. Fix **24hr at 4 ºC**, gently shaking

### 3. Post-fixation wash (replace fixative with 70% ethanol)
1. *Fume hood with proper PPE*
2. Prepare **70% ethanol solution (with RNAse/DNAse free water)** and keep at 4 ºC
3. Prepare and label waste containers: 1 bottle and one bag for contaminated solids
4. Remove fixative into formalin waste
5. Replace with 4 mL of cold (4ºC) 70% ethanol. Close tube.
6. Invert tube 3X and then discard the ethanol into same waste bottle.
7. Replace with fresh ethanol and store tubes in 4ºC Flammable Fridge.
   1. Label box as containing tissue in 70% ethanol (flammable!)

---

### 4. Prepare PBS and ethanol solutions to store at 4ºC
1. **PBS (DNAse/RNAse-free)**: 10 1X PBS tablets to 1 L of RNAse/DNAse-free molecular-grade water
2. **Ethanol in PBS**
   1. 50% ethanol: 25 mL 100% ethanol, 25 mL PBS
   2. 30% ethanol: 15 mL 100% ethanol, 35 mL PBS
   3. 10% ethanol: 5 mL 100% ethanol, 45 mL PBS
3. **Chill EDTA** - put a 50 mL aliquot at 4ºC per six-well plate at a time
   1. Main bottle is supposed to stay at room temperature to avoid precipitation

### 5. Rehydrate tissue
 - Goal: to remove excess ethanol before decalcification (EDTA and ethanol form a precipitate)

1. Sequentially replace solutions at 4 ºC with gentle shaking:  
   1. 70% ethanol -> **50% ethanol** (5 min)
   2. 50% ethanol -> **30% ethanol** (5 min)
   3. 30% ethanol -> **10% ethanol** (5 min)
   4. 10% ethanol -> RNAse/DNAse-free **PBS** (5 min)
   5. PBS -> fresh **PBS** (5 min)
2. Transfer tissue to **PBS in 6-well plate** (5 min)

### 6. Decalcification
1. Replace PBS with **cold 0.5 M EDTA (pH 8.0)**
2. Seal plate with parafilm, shake gently at 4 ºC overnight-5 days (depending on sample)
3. **Replace EDTA daily or every 48hr** until skeleton is dissolved.

---

### 7. PBS rinse
1. Replace EDTA in plate with PBS **gently without disturbing tissue**
2. Gently shake for 5-15 minutes at 4ºC
3. Repeat 2x more for 3 total rinses

### 8. Ethanol dehydration (can be done in 6-well plate or in beakers)
 1.  Prepare solutions in DNAse/RNAse-free Water (not PBS) and store at 4ºC
     1.  50% ethanol: 25 mL 100% ethanol, 25 mL water
     2.  70% ethanol: 35 mL 100% ethanol, 15 mL water
     3.  80% ethanol: 40 mL 100% ethanol, 10 mL water
     4.  95% ethanol: 47.5 mL 100% ethanol, 2.5 mL water
 2. Move tissue to histology cassettes to move through beakers, label with pencil/alcohol-resistant ink
    1. Alt: keep tissue in 6-well plate and replace the solution in the wells.
    2. Alt: move tissue wihthout cassette using tissue spatula
 3. Transfer tissue through the following solutions:
     1.  **50% ethanol**, 1 hr (4ºC)
     2.  **70% ethanol**, 1 hr (4ºC)
         1.  Can pause here overnight in 5mL tube at 4 ºC
     3.  **80% ethanol**, 30 min (4 ºC)
     4.  **95% ethanol**, 30 min (4 ºC)
     5.  **fresh 95% ethanol**, 30 min (4 ºC)
     6.  **100% ethanol**, 30 min (4 ºC) x 3
         1.  Replace twice for 1.5 hour total
   
### 9. Clearing
1.  *All steps in fume hood. Xylenes degrade plastic* -- only store in glass containers 
    1.  (**Also for xylene waste**)
2.  Incubate in **covered container** in xylene, 20 min X 3
    1. Replace xylenes twice for 1 hour total
    2. Use glass coplin jar, beaker, or glass petri dish 

### 10. Infiltration with and Embedding in paraffin

(Below is based almost entirely on the Squid Book, 2023 MBL Symbiosis Course, written by Derrick Kamp from Spencer Nyholm lab:)

#### Set up oven (54 ºC):
1. Line bottom of oven with aluminum foil to catch any drips of wax 
2.  Place forceps, molds, and all tools used during embedding on an aluminim foil-lined tray in oven so they do not harden wax upon contact
3.  Fill four autoclaved 250 mL beakers halfway with paraffin wax and place on tray
  1.  (Paraffin I, II, III, and IV)
4.  **Turn on oven (to  54 ºC) well ahead of time** (at start of dehydration) to allow wax to melt
5.  Put a foil-covered metal plate (or something?) at -20 ºC to be a solidifying plate
6.  If tissue is not already in a cassette, label a tissue casettes for each sample

#### Infiltration:
1. **Monitor and keep temperature constant so wax stays liquid without degrading tissue**
2. Submerge tissue in paraffin I for 45 min
3. Submerge tissue in paraffin II for 45 min
4. Submerge tissue in paraffin III for 45 min

#### Embedding:
1. Pour a small amount of paraffin IV into embedding mold in the oven
2. Using pre-heated forceps, move sample to paraffin mold
   1. Orient tissue to desired position 
   2. This step is time sensitive, as wax will start to cool and get sticky quickly
3. Remove lid from tissue cassette, place cassette open side up on top of tissue for labelling
4.  Fill mold with paraffin IV 
5.  Place tissue mold on solidifying plate on ice amd then pop out of mold and move to 4 ºC when fully hardened
6.  Solid blocks should be stored at 4ºC and shipped to facility for processing ASAP to maintain RNA integrity
