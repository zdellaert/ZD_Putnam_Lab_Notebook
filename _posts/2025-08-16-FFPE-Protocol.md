### Equipment

1. Shaker/rotating plate in cold room or 4 ºC fridge
2. Fume hood
3. Hot plate for paraffin embedding
4. Flammable-safe refrigerator

## Procedure

1. **Prepare 4% formalin** in seawater
   1. Collect seawater in clean container
   2. Filter seawater (in my case taken from the Putnam lab wetlab Blue Tanks) with a 0.2 uM filter into an autoclaved glass bottle
      1. I use a 30 mL syringe with an attached filter
   3. Close bottle tightly and UV sterilize for 30 minutes
   4. Prepare solution: Add 32.4 mL of formaldehyde to 267.6 mL of UV-sterilezed FSW (filtered seawater)
      1. *Prepare in fume hood with proper PPE*
   5. Fill 5mL tubes with fixative and keep at 4ºC in the dark until use
2. **Fixation**
   1. *Wear PPE (lab coat, gloves, eye covering)*
   2. Clip live coral directly into 5mL tube containing 4 mL of formalin
   3. Fix for for 24 hours at 4 ºC, gently shaking in cold room
3. **Post-fixation wash** (replace fixative with 70% ethanol)
   1. *In fume hood with proper PPE*
   2. Prepare 70% ethanol solution (with RNAse/DNAse free water) and keep at 4 ºC
   3. Prepare waste containers:
      1. Waste Bottle: 4% Formaldehyde in Seawater & 70% Ethanol
      2. Waste Bag: 4% Formaldehyde in Seawater- & 70% Ethanol-contaminated solids
   4. Remove fixative into formalin waste
   5. Replace with 4 mL of cold (4ºC) 70% ethanol (made with RNAse/DNAse-free water). Close tube.
   6. Invert tube 3X and then discard the ethanol into same waste bottle.
   7. Replace with fresh ethanol. 
   8. Move tubes to 4ºC Flammable Fridge.
      1. Make sure box is labelled as containing tissue in 70% ethanol (flammable!)
4. Prepare PBS and ethanol solutions to **store at 4ºC**
   1. Prepare **DNAse/RNAse-free PBS** 
      1. Add 10 1X PBS tablets (each makes 100mL) to 1 L of RNAse/DNAse-free molecular-grade water
   2. Prepare ethanol in PBS
      1. 50% ethanol: 25 mL 100% ethanol, 25 mL PBS
      2. 30% ethanol: 15 mL 100% ethanol, 35 mL PBS
      3. 10% ethanol: 5 mL 100% ethanol, 45 mL PBS
   3. Chill 50 mL aliquot of EDTA at 4ºC per six-well plate at a time
      1. Main bottle is supposed to stay at room temperature to avoid precipitation
5. **Rehydrate tissue**
   1. Goal: to remove excess ethanol before decalcification (EDTA and ethanol form a precipitate)
   2. Replace 70% ethanol with **50% ethanol** (Gently shake for 5 minutes at 4ºC)
   1. Replace 50% ethanol with **30% ethanol** (shake 5 minutes, 4 ºC)
   2. Replace 30% ethanol with **10% ethanol** (shake 5 minutes, 4 ºC)
   3. Replace 10% ethanol with RNAse/DNAse-free **PBS** (shake 5 minutes, 4 ºC)
   4. Replace with fresh **PBS** (shake 5 minutes, 4 ºC)
   5. Transfer tissue to 6-well plate filled with **PBS** (shake 5 minutes, 4 ºC)
6. **Decalcification**
   1. Replace PBS with **cold 0.5 M EDTA (pH 8.0)**
   2. Seal plate with parafilm and place on an absorbent pad
   3. Keep tissue in EDTA at 4ºC, gently shaking on rotating plate overnight for 72 hours - 1 week depending on sample
   4. **Replace EDTA daily or every 2 days until skeleton is dissolved.**
7. **PBS rinse**
   1. Replace EDTA in plate with PBS **gently without disturbing tissue**
   2. Gently shake for 5-15 minutes at 4ºC
   3. Repeat 2x more for 3 total rinses in PBS
8.  **Ethanol dehydration** (can be done in 6-well plate or in beakers)
    1.  Prepare solutions in DNAse/RNAse-free Water (not PBS) and store at 4ºC
        1.  50% ethanol: 25 mL 100% ethanol, 25 mL water
        2.  70% ethanol: 35 mL 100% ethanol, 15 mL water
        3.  80% ethanol: 40 mL 100% ethanol, 10 mL water
        4.  95% ethanol: 47.5 mL 100% ethanol, 2.5 mL water
    2.  Transfer tissue using spatulas or histology cassettes (label with pencil/alcohol-resistant ink).
    3.  **50% ethanol**, 1 hour at 4ºC
    1.  **70% ethanol**, 1 hour at 4ºC
        1.  Can put into sealed containers (5mL tubes) at 4 ºC to pause here overnight
    2.  **80% ethanol**, 1 hour at 4ºC
    3.  **95% ethanol**, 30 minutes at 4ºC
    4.  Move to **fresh 95% ethanol**, 30 minutes at 4ºC
    5.  Move to **100% ethanol**, 30 minutes at 4ºC
        1.  Repeat twice for 1.5 hour total in 100% ethanol
9.  **Clearing**
    1.  Notes: 
        1.  Perform all steps in fume hood.
        2.  *Xylenes degrade plastic* -- only store in glass containers (**Also for xylene waste**)
    2.  Incubate in xylene for 20 minutes, **with gentle agitation**
        1. Replace xylenes twice for 1 hour total
        2. Perform incubation in glass coplin jar or glass petri dish 
10. **Infiltration with paraffin**
    1.  Melt paraplast wax to 50-54 ºC (or melting point of specific paraffin bought) and allow to cool
    2.  Incubate tissue in melted wax (glass petri dishes or beaker)
        1.  **30 minutes x 3** incubations with fresh paraffin (90 mins total)
    3.  Keep temperature constant so wax stays liquid without degrading tissue
11. Embedding in paraffin
    1.  step 1
    2.  step 2
