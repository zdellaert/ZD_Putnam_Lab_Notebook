## Procedure

1. Prepare 4% formalin in seawater
   1. Collect seawater in container
   2. Filter seawater (in my case taken from the Putnam lab wetlab Blue Tanks) with a 0.2 uM filter into an autoclaved glass bottle
      1. I use a 30 mL syringe with an attached filter
   3. Close bottle tightly and place in UV sterilizing box for 30 minutes
   4. Add 32.4 mL of formaldehyde to 267.6 mL of UV-sterilezed FSW (filtered seawater)
2. Fill 5mL tubes with fixative and keep at 4ºC in the dark until use
3. Fix coral in 4 mL of formalin for 24 hours at 4 ºC, shaking in cold room
4. 24 hours later: Wash fixative and replace with 70% ethanol
   1. This needs to be done in the hood, wearing a lab coat. Use the serilogical pipette labelled formalin/paxgene and 5mL serilogical pipettes. Can also use the 5mL pipette with 5mL pipette tubes (micropipette style)
   2. Prepare waste containers:
      1. Waste Bottle: 4% Formaldehyde in Seawater & 70% Ethanol
      2. Waste Bag: 4% Formaldehyde in Seawater- & 70% Ethanol-contaminated solids
   3. Remove fixative from 5mL into labeled formalin waste bottle
   4. Replace with 4 mL of cold (4ºC) 70% ethanol (made with RNAse/DNAse-free water). Close tube.
   5. Perform 1 wash - invert tube 3X and then remove the PAXgene tissue stabilizer into same waste bottle.
   6. Replace with fresh 4 mL of cold (4ºC) 70% ethanol (made with RNAse/DNAse-free water). Close tube.
   7. Move tubes to designated box in 4ºC Flammable Fridge. Make sure box is labelled as containing tissue in 70% ethanol(flammable!)
5. Prepare PBS and ethanol solutions and place at 4ºC
   1. Prepare DNAse/RNAse-free PBS 
      1. Add 10 1X PBS tablets (each makes 100mL) to 1 L of RNAse/DNAse-free molecular-grade water and store at 4ºC
   2. Prepare 50%, 30%, and 10% solutions of ethanol in DNAse/RNAse-free PBS and store at 4ºC
      1. 50% ethanol: 25 mL 100% ethanol, 25 mL PBS
      2. 30% ethanol: 15 mL 100% ethanol, 35 mL PBS
      3. 10% ethanol: 5 mL 100% ethanol, 45 mL PBS
   3. Put a 50 mL aliquot of EDTA at 4ºC per six-well plate
      1. I keep 50 mL aliquot of EDTA cold at a time (12-24 hours) because the bottle is supposed to stay at room temperature to avoid precipitation
6. Rehydrate tissue to remove excess ethanol before decalcification (EDTA and ethanol form a precipitate that we don't want interfering)
   1. Replace 70% ethanol with **50% ethanol** (made with RNAse/DNAse-free PBS)
      1. Gently shake for 5 minutes at 4ºC
   2. Replace 50% ethanol with **30% ethanol** (made with RNAse/DNAse-free PBS)
      1. Gently shake for 5 minutes at 4ºC
   3. Replace 30% ethanol with **10% ethanol** (made with RNAse/DNAse-free PBS)
      1. Gently shake for 5 minutes at 4ºC
   4. Replace 10% ethanol with RNAse/DNAse-free **PBS**
      1. Gently shake for 5 minutes at 4ºC
   5. Replace with fresh RNAse/DNAse-free **PBS**
      1. Gently shake for 5 minutes at 4ºC
   6. Transfer tissue to LABELED well of 6-well plate filled with RNAse/DNAse-free **PBS**
      1. Gently shake for 5 minutes at 4ºC
7. Decalcify
   1. Replace RNAse/DNAse-free PBS in each well of the 6-well plate with **cold 0.5 M EDTA (pH 8.0)**
   2. Seal plate with parafilm and place on an absorbent surface to catch condensation droplets
   3. Keep tissue in EDTA at 4ºC, gently shaking on rotating plate overnight for 72 hours - 1 week depending on sample
   4. **Replace EDTA daily or every 2 days until skeleton is dissolved.**
8. Rinse decalcified tissue with RNAse/DNAse-free PBS (replace EDTA in plate with PBS **gently without disturbing tissue**)
   1. Gently shake for 5-15 minutes at 4ºC
   2. Repeat twice for 3 total rinses in PBS
9. Ethanol dehydration (can be done in beakers)
   1.  Prepare 50%, 70%, 80%, and 95% solutions of ethanol in DNAse/RNAse-free Water (not PBS) and store at 4ºC
      1. 50% ethanol: 25 mL 100% ethanol, 25 mL water
      2. 70% ethanol: 35 mL 100% ethanol, 15 mL water
      3. 80% ethanol: 40 mL 100% ethanol, 10 mL water
      4. 95% ethanol: 47.5 mL 100% ethanol, 2.5 mL water
   2.  Move tissue to histology cassette to gently transfer between solutions or move one piece of tissue at a time with tissue spatuals
       1.  Label with pencil or alcohol-resistant marker
       2.  Porites and montipora tissue don't do too well in the casettes - move with spatulas
   3.  Incubate in **50% ethanol** solution, 1 hour at 4ºC
   4.  Incubate in **70% ethanol** solution, 1 hour at 4ºC
       1. Can put into sealed containers (5mL tubes) at 4 ºC to pause here overnight
   5.  Incubate in **80% ethanol** solution, 1 hour at 4ºC
   6.  Incubate in **95% ethanol** solution, 30 minutes at 4ºC
   7.  Move to **fresh** 95% ethanol, incubate 30 minutes at 4ºC
   8.  Move to **100% ethanol**
       1.  30 minutes at 4ºC
       2.  Replace with fresh 100% ethanol twice for a total of 3 30 minute incubations in 100% ethanol (1.5 hour total)
10. Clearing (**DO IN FUME HOOD**)
    1.  Xylenes degrade plastic -- only store in glass containers (**Also xylene waste**)
    2.  Incubate in xylene in glass coplin jar or glass petri dish for 20 minutes, **with gentle agitation**
        1.  Replace with fresh xylene twice for a total of 3 20 minute incubations in xylene (1 hour total)
11. Infiltration with paraffin
    1.  Melt paraplast wax to 60 ºC and allow to cool
        1.  **check these temperatures**
        2.  we bought low-melting point wax, the temp may be 54 ºC
    2.  Incubate tissue in melted wax (keep temperature constant so wax stays liquid without increasing in temp) 
        1.  Do in glass petri dishes or beaker
        2.  Incubate for 30 minutes
        3.  Replace with fresh melted paraffin twce for a total of 3 30 minute infiltrations with paraffin (90 mins total)
12. Embedding in paraffin
