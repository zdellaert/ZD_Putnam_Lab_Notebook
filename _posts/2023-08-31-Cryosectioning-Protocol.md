## Protocol for Cryosectioning PAXgene-fixed Tissues (for FISH, Immunofluorescence, and LCM)

### Starting material: Tissue fixed, stabilized, decalcified ([protocol](https://zdellaert.github.io/ZD_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/PAXgene-Fix-Decalc-Protocol/)), and [embedded in OCT](https://zdellaert.github.io/ZD_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/Cryoembedding-Protocol/)

### The goal of this protocol is to create tissue sections that preserve structural integrity and maintain the integrity of RNA and proteins for downstream imaging and RNA extraction

### Therefore, all of these steps should be performed with gloves and in a clean workspace

## Input material:
1. Start with [fixed tissue](https://zdellaert.github.io/ZD_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/), [embedded in a block of OCT]((https://zdellaert.github.io/ZD_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/Cryoembedding-Protocol/)) that has been kept at -80 ºC in a sealed container (large tube, wrapped in foil, in whirlpack, etc)
2. 30 minutes before sectioning, move block containing tissue to -20 ºC freezer. Keep in sealed container. Transport to cryostat on dry ice.

## Sectioning 

1. Clean cryostat and all tools with 70% Ethanol and/or RNAse zap (depending on application)
    - Clean cryostat, microtome blade and tools with a 1:1 mixture of RNaseZap and 70% ethanol (RNaseZap/70% ethanol) and then with sterile 95% ethanol (Recipes 1-3). Wipe dry with Kimwipes. (from [Roy et al 2020](https://github.com/zdellaert/ZD_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/protocols/BioProtoc-10-01-3475.pdf))
    ![cryostat.jpeg](https://github.com/zdellaert/ZD_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/images/protocols/cryosection/cryostat.jpeg?raw=true)
2. Use clingwrap to cover internal surfaces
    ![cryostat_clingwrap.jpeg](https://github.com/zdellaert/ZD_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/images/protocols/cryosection/cryostat_clingwrap.jpeg?raw=true)
3. Place all tools in cryostat and allow to equilibriate to cryostat temperature (~30 mins!, speed up by transporting on dry ice before sectioning)
4. Mount sample onto chuck by placing a drop of OCT on the chuck and then placing the demoulded block on top
5. Trim off excess OCT from the outside to make the section area smaller, making sure not to cut the tissue. If you do not know where the tissue is, wait to trim OCT until you can see the face of the section.
5. "Face" the tissue by using the "trim" setting (thicker sections, ~30 uM) to reveal the desired tissue face 
    - Goal is to get a nice clean section across the whole face of the block. 
    - To do so, you will have to adjust the angle of the sample holder accordingly. As you trim away sections, you will notice the first try will not be nicely in the center of the block. Adjust the angle of the sample holder horizontally and vertically and keep "trimming" until you get a flat section across the whole block.
    - **Always lock the wheel when adjusting things inside the cryostat and stay clear of the blade!**
6. Once desired "face" is achieved, sectioning for the slides can begin 
    - A good time to move to a different section of the blade, which you should do periodically especially if you notice any issues with the sections going through
    - Turn off the "trim" setting and set the thickness for sectioning.
    - **10 uM thickness is ideal**, but thicker may be easier and may have less rolling issues.
7. Adjust roll plate so sections stay flat
    - This is the hardest part! 
    - If you are having issues, make sure to regularly clean the blade (**carefully!**) and the anti-roll plate. Any nicks or residue will hamper good sectioning
    - Other possible fixes: adjust blade or sample angle (I have had success with ~3º blade angle)
        - [Leica](https://github.com/zdellaert/ZD_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/protocols/Leica_AntiRoll.pdf) suggests to start at an angle of 0º and slowly (1º at a time) adjust up
    - If there is any bunching or ripping of the sections, adjust the temperature colder (for crumpling/bunching) or warmer (for ripping/cracking). I have had success with -15 ºC - -20ºC.

5. Pick up sections using slide
    - Remove the anti-roll plate and gently use paintbrushes to slide sections away from the blade, pick up the section on the frosted side of the slide (or membrane side if for LCM) with a rolling motion. Warm the slide from the back with the tip of your finger behind the section to allow the section to quickly melt. Place on the cryostat metal plate (where the blade is) to refreeze.

6. Keep slides in the cryostat and transport in sealed containers (slide mailers wrapped in parafilm and then placed in zip lock bag) on dry ice

## Quick slide staining w/ Hoescht

- Might try to get H&E stains to do morphology checks as well

- For staining, take slides out of freezer and let any condensation evaporate.
    - Optional: *Remove excess OCT with forceps, should peel right off*
    - Rinse slides in 1X PBS for 10 minutes to remove OCT (in 50mL falcon tube)
        - or 70 % Ethanol
    - **Use pap pen to encircle section** and cover with PBS, perform staining and washing steps by pipetting off the drop of liquid and replacing with staining solution
    - Hoescht staining: 
        - make 1 µg/ml solution of Hoescht 
            - add 0.001 g to 1 mL of RNAse/DNAse free H2O
            - wrap tube in aluminum foil to keep dark and store at -20ºC 
        - Add 100 uL of the Hoescht solution to each section and allow to stain in the dark for 5 mins.
    - Wash in 1X PBS in dark
    - Remove excess liquid by aspirating and pat dry area around sample with Kimwipe
    - Air dry, covered to prevent dust from accumulating
    - Apply a few microliters of mounting media, avoiding any bubbles
        - Mounting media tips
            - Take mounting media out of the fridge ~30 mins before mounting and store upside down to try to limit bubbles forming and getting onto the tissue
    - Cover with a large coverlslip (22x50)
    - Seal with nail polish allow slides to cure overnight (4 ºC in dark).
    - Image using confocal!
        - Hoescht: excited with **410‐nm**, collect at **490‐nm** (bandpass)
        - Chlorophyll: **410‐nm**, collect at **610‐nm** (long‐pass)
        - GFP: excited with **488‐nm**, collect at **533‐nm** (bandpass)
