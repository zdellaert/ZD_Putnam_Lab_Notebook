## Protocol for Cryosectioning PAXgene-fixed Tissues (for FISH, Immunofluorescence, and LCM)

### Starting material: Tissue fixed, stabilized, decalcified ([example here, full protocol coming soon](https://zdellaert.github.io/ZD_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/Paxgene-Decalcification-Sections-Test/)), and [embedded in OCT](https://zdellaert.github.io/ZD_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/Cryoembedding-Protocol/)

### Example Protocols and Video

See Video from 10X genomics: [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNrnnmQB8y0)

[PAXgene cryosectioning protocol](https://www.preanalytix.com/storage/download/_ProductResources_/SuppProtocols/HB-1543-S01-001_PX20_SP_TIssue_System_Preparation_of_sections_from_PFPE_and_PFCE_tissues_for_manual_or_LMD_1015_WW.pdf)

### The goal of this protocol is to create tissue sections that preserve structural integrity and maintain the integrity of RNA and proteins for downstream imaging and RNA extraction

### Therefore, all of these steps should be performed with gloves and in a clean workspace

## Input material:
1. Start with [fixed tissue](https://zdellaert.github.io/ZD_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/), [embedded in a block of OCT]((https://zdellaert.github.io/ZD_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/Cryoembedding-Protocol/)) that has been kept at -80 ºC in a sealed container (large tube, wrapped in foil, in whirlpack, etc)

## Sectioning
1. Section using Cryostat at URI core facility
    - Sections can be about 10 uM thick
    - Let dry at RT for 10 mins then keep on dry ice and put in -80 ºC freezer.
        - How to store slides: Keep slides in a slide box (need to order), and wrap in a plastic bag to prevent any moisture from getting in or out of the box

**NOTES: Ideal temp is -15 ºC for cutting and ideal blade angle is 3º**

- adjust blade angle
- move blade around
- how to figure out sample angle
- locking handle

- Notes from [Roy et al 2020 Bioprotocols](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7079735/):
        - Clean cryostat, microtome blade and tools with a 1:1 mixture of RNaseZap and 70% ethanol (RNaseZap/70% ethanol) and then with sterile 95% ethanol (Recipes 1-3). Wipe dry with Kimwipes.
            - Mix RNaseZap and 70% ethanol in 1:1 ratio. Mix the two liquids by rocking the bottle sideways for 4-5 min
        - Incubate PEN membrane slides for 30 min under UV light (on the UV transilluminator) to enhance the binding of the tissue to the membrane slide.
        - Get a bucket of dry ice for tissue/embedded mold transportation.
        - Prepare solutions with RNase-free water and high-quality ethanol:
            - 75% ethanol (freshly prepared, Recipe 4)
        - Set temperature of cryostat in the range of -15 °C to -18 °C
        - Label PEN slides using a pencil.


## Quick slide staining w/ Hoescht

- Might try to get H&E stains to do morphology checks as well

- For staining, take slides out of freezer and let any condensation evaporate.
    - Remove excess OCT with forceps, should peel right off
    - Rinse slides in 1X PBS for 10 minutes to remove OCT (in 50mL falcon tube)
    - Incubate in PBST (1x PBS with 0.2% (v/v) Triton-X-100) bath for 10 min (in 50mL falcon tube)
        - To make 50mL of PBST, combine 50 mL of 1X PBS with 0.1 mL (100uL) of Triton-X-100. Shake the Triton-X-100 well before adding to the PBS.
    - Rinse again in 1X PBS, then remove excess liquid.
    - **Use pap pen to encircle section** and cover with PBS, perform staining and washing steps by pipetting off the drop of liquid and replacing with staining solution
    - Hoescht staining: 
        - make 1 µg/ml solution of Hoescht 
            - add 0.001 g to 1 mL of RNAse/DNAse free H2O
            - wrap tube in aluminum foil to keep dark and store at -20ºC
