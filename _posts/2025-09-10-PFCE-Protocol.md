## Procedure

Old Protocol with pictures [here](https://zdellaert.github.io/ZD_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/PAXgene-Fix-Decalc-Protocol/)

### Preparation
1. Clean bench and metal tools (clippes, forceps) with clean paper towels (spray solution, wipe down) in the following order:
    - 10% bleach solution
    - DI water
    - 70% ethanol
    - RNAse cleaner (spray bottle)

### 1. Fixation
1. *Wear PPE (lab coat, gloves, eye covering)*
2. Prepare fixative tubes: transfer 4 mL of PAXgene tissue fixative from a tissue fixative container (they come in 50 mL plastic jars) to a 5 mL screw-cap tube
3. Clip live coral directly into 4 mL of PAXgene (5 mL tube)
4. Fix **24hr at 4 ºC**, gently shaking at 150 rpm

### 2. Post-fixation wash (replace fixative with stabilizer)
1. *Fume hood with proper PPE*
2. Add specified amount of ethanol to PAXgene tissue stabilizer and keep at 4 ºC
3. Prepare and label waste containers: 1 bottle and one bag for contaminated solids
4. Remove fixative into PAXgene fixative + stabilizer waste bottle
5. Replace with 4 mL of cold (4ºC) stabilizer. Close tube.
6. Invert tube 3X and then discard the stabilizer into same waste bottle.
7. Replace with fresh stabilizer and store tubes in 4ºC Flammable Fridge.
   1. Label box as containing tissue in PAXgene tissue stabilizer (flammable!)

---

### 3. Prepare PBS to store at 4ºC
1. **PBS (DNAse/RNAse-free)**: 10 1X PBS tablets to 1 L of RNAse/DNAse-free molecular-grade water
2. **Chill EDTA** - put a 50 mL aliquot at 4ºC per six-well plate at a time
   1. Main bottle is supposed to stay at room temperature to avoid precipitation

### 4. Rehydrate tissue
 - Goal: to remove excess stabilizer (contains ethanol) before decalcification (EDTA and ethanol form a precipitate)

1. Transfer tissue to **DNAse/RNAse-free PBS in 6-well plate** at 4 ºC
2. Shake gently for 15 minutes to wash tissue. Can alternatively change the PBS 2x for 3 5 minute washes.

### 5. Decalcification
1. Replace PBS with **cold 0.5 M EDTA (pH 8.0)**
2. Seal plate with parafilm, shake gently at 4 ºC overnight-5 days (depending on sample)
3. **Replace EDTA daily or every 48hr** until skeleton is dissolved.

### 6. Prepare sucrose solutions
1. **15% sucrose**: Add 7.5 g sucrose to 50 mL DNAse/RNAse-free PBS in a 50mL falcon tube.
   - Aliquot into 15 mL falcon tubes for each sample. Store at 4 ºC.
2. **30% sucrose**: Add 15 g sucrose to 50 mL DNAse/RNAse-free PBS.
   - Aliquot into 15 mL falcon tubes for each sample. Store at 4 ºC.

### 7. PBS rinse
1. Replace EDTA in plate with PBS **gently without disturbing tissue**
2. Gently shake for 5 minutes at 4ºC
3. Repeat 2x more for 3 total rinses

### 8. Cryoprotection
1. Once the tissue is decalcified, it is very fragile and difficult to pick up. I use sterilized, very fine forceps or LevGo Tissue Spatulas.
2. Transfer each tissue very carefully using a tissue spatuala to an individually **labelled** 15 mL tube or 6-well plate containing 15 % sucrose
3. Incubate 10 minutes or until tissue sinks at 4 ºC
   - Often the tissue sinks immediately
4. Transfer each to **labelled** 15 mL tube or 6-well plate containing 30 % sucrose
   1. Incubate until tissue sinks, usually **overnight**
   
### 9. Embedding 

Old embedding Protocol [here](https://zdellaert.github.io/ZD_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/Cryoembedding-Protocol/) has pictures, but this one is much more up to date/ideal for careful RNA work.

1. If possible, embed in cold room at 4ºC
   1. Cool tools, OCT, cryomolds, and CryoELITE® Tissue Vials to 4ºC by putting on dry ice or in cold room while preparing everything
2. Gather cooler of dry ice and use mortar and pestle to crush some pieces of dry ice into a fine powder
   1. I use a cleaned tip box lid as a container for the powdered dry ice
3. Label cryomold with sample information
4. Label cryovial for tissue block storage
5. Prepare a page in lab notebook for recording tissue orientiation information
   1. take pictures if possible
6. Fill labelled cryomold with a small amount cooled OCT (about halfway full), being careful to not make any bubbles
    - If bubbles form, push to side of block with clean forceps or clean pipette tip
7. Using sterilized and cooled forceps, transfer tissue from PAXgene stabilizer or sucrose to a piece of cleaned parafilm
8. Dab the surrounding liquid (NOT the tissue itself) with the corner of a kim wipe to remove excess liquid
   1. Get tissue as dry as possible
9.  Immediately place into OCT in cryomold and record orientation information
10. Fill in cryomold with additional OCT, reposition tissue as needed
   1.  Dispense OCT very slowly
11. While recording information and repositioning tissue to be as desired, we give the tissue 1-2 minutes to soak in OCT before freezing - we want crevaces to be filled in with OCT
12. Place cryomold on powdered dry ice so all outside surfaces of the mold are touching powdered dry ice until OCT block is completely opaque (~2-5 minutes)
     - do not allow dry ice to touch the tissue or OCT at all
     - I do this in a cleaned tip container filled with powdered dry ice to easily move around and position the block carefully, but while freezing I transfer this into a larger cooler filled with dry ice to keep it as cold as possible
     - dry ice-100% ethanol slurry is also possible
13. Once embedded tissue block is opaque, work quickly to demold and score block with razor blade to preserve orientation (record where the score is on your drawing!)
14. If the tissue was at the very of the bottom of the mold and is visible through the OCT, it could have the potential to be exposed to air
    1.  Add an extra dab of OCT on the bottom where the mold was and freeze on parafilm on dry ice
15. Transfer to labelled, cooled cryovial, and immediately transfer (on dry ice) to -80 freezer
