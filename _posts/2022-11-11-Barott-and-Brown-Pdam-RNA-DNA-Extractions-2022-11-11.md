## Notes

- Continuting processing the Barott and Brown Pdam samples using the protocol detailed on [10/27/22.](https://zdellaert.github.io/ZD_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/Barott-and-Brown-Pdam-RNA-DNA-Extractions-2022-10-27/)

**- Had much higher qubit values here because I started putting two of the tiny fragments into the bead beat tubes instead of one. Mostly this meant I only had to bead beat most samples for 1 minute instead of 2 to get a dark colored solution and resulted in great RNA! But I think the previous samples are great too, just slightly less in concentration.**

- See bead-beating notes below with Qubit values.

## Qubit Results

- Used Broad range dsDNA and RNA Qubit [Protocol](https://meschedl.github.io/MESPutnam_Open_Lab_Notebook/Qubit-Protocol/)
- All samples read twice, standard only read once

## DNA and RNA Quality Check: Gel, using [Kristina's gel protocol at the bottom of this page.](https://zdellaert.github.io/ZD_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/Protocols_Zymo_Quick_DNA_RNA_Miniprep_Plus/)

And yes, we ran out of ladder. I think we have more but I could not find it.

## Next steps

All done with these samples! Will check in with Hollie to see next steps for the extracted RNA and DNA. We could maybe redo some of the lower concentration extractions and add more tissue into the bead-beating steps for those.

I did re-QC the following five samples that had originally "nd" values for RNA quantity when measured using the RNA Broad Range Qubit kit. I thawed the RNA on ice and measured their RNA quantity using the Qubit RNA High Sensitivity kit, which uses different reagents and standards but the exact same [protocol as the BR kit.](https://meschedl.github.io/MESPutnam_Open_Lab_Notebook/Qubit-Protocol/).

| Sample # | RNA_QBIT_1 | RNA_QBIT_2 | RNA_QBIT_AVG |
|----------|------------|------------|--------------|
| RF25A    | 10.5       | 10.3       | 10.4         |
| RS14C    | 6.48       | 6.48       | 6.48         |
| RS15D    | 6.84       | 7.04       | 6.94         |
| RF14B    | 12.7       | 12.6       | 12.65        |
| RF15D    | 11.6       | 11.1       | 11.35        |

All of them look okay, but we could possibly redo the extractions with more tissue at the bead-beat step, especially for those with concentrations below 10.
