# Specific Title Pertaining to Method and Samples Processed

### Include a Link to the protocol (from your lab notebook) used for processing these samples. Also include links and details for anything you used that is different from that post.

**Goal for Processing:**  What was your goal for the day?  
**Major Results** What is your major result with respect to your goal?  
**Major Take Aways**  Are there any broader conclusions that came from your labwork today, or links to other posts?

**Components**

- List/table of samples that you processed this day
- Mention **all** things that went differently in this day's processing that aren't in the referenced protocol
- Note if a sample is a re-processing or not
- If you are making a library, provide a table of the multiplexing done, and include the index/barcode sequences if available
- If you are putting something in a 96 well plate for the plate reader, include a plate map of where your samples went

**QC/Data Acquired**

- List all QC measures performed for this processing, if you have links to posts about their protocols, include them here.
- Provide all data for QC ex: Qubit table, gel image, volumes of homogenized tissue, plate reader outputs, tapestation reports

**Next Steps**
- Will you be re-doing some samples?
- Are there many more samples to process in the same way going forward?
- Are you going to be scaling up the processing level once you are comfortable with the protocol?
- Etc etc etc
