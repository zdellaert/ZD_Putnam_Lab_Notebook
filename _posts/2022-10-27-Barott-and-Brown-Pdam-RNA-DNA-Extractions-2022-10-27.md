## RNA and DNA Extractions for Brown/Barott Pdam Project, October 27, 2022

### [Protocol Link](https://zdellaert.github.io/ZD_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/Protocols_Zymo_Quick_DNA_RNA_Miniprep_Plus/)

### Extraction of 4 samples from Pocillopora damicornis (Pdam) from Heron Island in RNAlater March 2021 (Kristen Brown, Postdoc in Katie Barott lab)

## Samples

## Notes

- Today I tested our protocol on these samples. I had to adjust the protocol slightly because they were preserved in RNAlater instead of DNA/RNA shield. I did the following:

    1. Thawed samples **on ice**.
    2. With sterilized forceps (10% bleach, DEPC water, 70% ethanol, air-dried), I removed one small (5mm x 5mm) fragment from the tube, in which most tubes had 5-6 small fragments of this size. I sterilized forceps between each sample.
    3. I briefly transferred this fragment to a clean 1.5 mL tube on ice to tap off any excess RNAlater and then immediately transferred the fragment to a 1.5 mL screw-cap tube with 800 uL DNA/RNA shield and 0.25 mL of 0.5mm glass beads.
    4. Bead beat for 1-2 minutes on the vortex at max speed. I started off with one minute for all samples but added a minute of bead-beating for samples if the liquid still looked very light-colored after one minute of homogenization.
    5. Briefly spin down and remove 400 uL of supernatant into a clean tube. Spin for 3 mins at 9,000 rcf.
    6. Put original samples and bead tubes back in -80 ÂºC freezer.
    7. Remove 300 uL of the supernatant into a new tube and continue on with the protocol below (from the Pro K step) as written.

- Other than the adjustments mentioned above, I followed [protocol](https://zdellaert.github.io/ZD_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/Protocols_Zymo_Quick_DNA_RNA_Miniprep_Plus/) exactly.

- For my records: opened new kit today (Kit labelled 1/2 rec'd 10/4/22), used the columns, collection tubes, and DNA digestion buffer from this new kit.

- I bead-beat RS6D and RF25A for 2 mins instead of 1 min because they were still light-colored after one minute of bead-beating.

## Qubit Results

- Used Broad range dsDNA and RNA Qubit [Protocol](https://zdellaert.github.io/ZD_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/Qubit-Protocol/)
- All samples read twice, standard only read once

## DNA and RNA Quality Check: Gel, using [Kristina's gel protocol at the bottom of this page.](https://zdellaert.github.io/ZD_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/Protocols_Zymo_Quick_DNA_RNA_Miniprep_Plus/)

## Next steps

Will use this protocol on the rest of the samples.
