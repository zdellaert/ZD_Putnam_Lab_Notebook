## RNA and DNA Extractions for ENCORE Project, October 03, 2022

### [Protocol Link](https://zdellaert.github.io/ZD_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/Protocols_Zymo_Quick_DNA_RNA_Miniprep_Plus/)

### Extraction of 8 samples from ENCORE Project. These samples were collected in Bermuda in August 2022 for the ENCORE TPC project. There are 160 samples total from the following 4 species: *Diploria labyrinthiformis* (DLAB), *Montastraea cavernosa* (MCAV), *Madracis decactis* (MDEC), and *Porites astreoides* (PAST).

## Samples:
These samples are part of our "Round A" of processing. We selected 16 samples from the 160 that were representative of all 4 species at the following 4 temperatures: 16 ºC, 26 ºC, 29 ºC, and 36 ºC. Within each species, the four samples selected for "Round A" all originated from different colonies (given by the letter after the species. For example, for sample Dlab-D1, the colony was colony D and the fragment was fragment 1.)

## Notes:
- Followed [protocol](https://zdellaert.github.io/ZD_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/Protocols_Zymo_Quick_DNA_RNA_Miniprep_Plus/) exactly. Took 300 uL from each sample tube.

- Sample Past-F4 looked bad at the step where DNA/RNA Lysis buffer was added to the supernatant at [step 6](https://zdellaert.github.io/ZD_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/Protocols_Zymo_Quick_DNA_RNA_Miniprep_Plus/). The supernatant from the Proteinase K digestion appeared to be mucous-y and was immiscible with the Lysis buffer. Throughout the RNA extraction, the filter was pigmented and the RNA was pale brown. This might be an example sample to re-extract with only 100 or 150 uL of the DNA/RNA shield from the sample tube.

## Qubit Results
 - Used Broad range dsDNA and RNA Qubit [Protocol](https://zdellaert.github.io/ZD_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/Qubit-Protocol/)
 - All samples read twice, standard only read once

## DNA and RNA Quality Check: Gel, using [Kristina's gel protocol at the bottom of this page.](https://zdellaert.github.io/ZD_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/Protocols_Zymo_Quick_DNA_RNA_Miniprep_Plus/)

## Next steps:

I will try to re-extract the two PAST samples, this time taking only 150 uL of the DNA/RNA shield from the sample tube and diluting this with another 150 uL prior to the Proteinase K digestion.
