## Testing Paxgene Fixative, PAXgene Tissue Stabilizer, Sectioning,  Decalcification, and Extraction of DNA/RNA using Zymo Quick DNA/RNA Protocol from Stabilized Samples (Time Course), April 4, 2023

## Testing Decalcification with PAXgene Fixative and PAXgene Tissue Stabilizer

Over the last few weeks I have been the PAXgene Fixative and PAXgene Tissue Stabilizer for adult coral sample fixation with better-preserved RNA and DNA than traditional formalin/formaldehyde/Z-fix fixation. I now want to attempt to decalcify coral samples after PAXgene fixation. 

The plan is to fix more fragments in PAXgene fixative [as before](https://zdellaert.github.io/ZD_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/Paxgene-Fixation-Extraction-Test/), but now to create small disks, or "sections," of the fixed coral with a razor blade and to decalcify these disks using various methods. Some disks will stay un-decalcified as controls. Then I will attempt to extract RNA and DNA from all the disks and see if decalcification method affected RNA and DNA quality or quantity.

Here are the different trials:

- No decalcifcation (control)
- HCl decalcifcation
- HCl decalcifcation, on ice
- EDTA decalcifcation
- EDTA decalcifcation, on ice
- Morse's solution decalcifcation
- Morse's solution decalcifcation, on ice

Order of operations:

1. Fix branchlets in PAXgene fixative for 24 hours.
2. Transfer branchlets to PAXgene stabilizer for at least 2 hours at 4ºC to allow for penetration of stabilizer into the tissues.
3. Cut branchlets into disks and record weight - divide into various decalcification treatments.
4. After decalcification, samples should go straight into labelled tubes with PAXgene stabilizer, possibly with another 4 ºC incubation step to allow for PAXgene stabilizer penetration into tissue, and then stored at -80ºC. (We can also test putting them in the fridge)
5. Then extract these using Zymo RNA extraction kit. Weighing starting material to try to keep it consistent is a good idea. 
   1. Bead-beat 2 mins with DNA/RNA shield or not?

How to tell when decalc is done? Disk needs to float.

Do we have a cold room? How does this compare to decalcifying on ice?
