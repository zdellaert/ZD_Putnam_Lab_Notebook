# Testing Paxgene Fixative, PAXgene Tissue Stabilizer, and Extraction of DNA/RNA using Zymo Quick DNA/RNA Protocol from Stabilized Samples (Time Course), March 21, 2023

## Testing PAXgene Fixative and PAXgene Tissue Stabilizer

In this protocol, I tested the use of [PAXgene Tissue Fix Containers](https://www.preanalytix.com/products/tissue/fixation-stabilization/paxgene-tissue-fix-container/US?cHash=359b54c939cac03cdaad44c02dd2cb61) for coral. I used a sample of *Pocillopora acuta* from our Putnam Lab Wetlab.

On March 20, 2023, I cut off four branchlets of about 5 mm long and carried these to the lab in a 5mL tube filled with seawater from the aquarium. In the fume hood, I transferred (with sterile forceps) all four branchlets to a labelled PAXgene Tissue Fix container.

I fixed these four branchlets for 24 hours at room temperature (in the fume hood). The color from the fragments immediately begain leaching into the solution and after 2 hours the fragments looked completely white.

After 24 hours, I poured off the PAXgene fixative into a labelled waste container (in fume hood) and immediately filled the container with PAXgene stabilizer (350mL Ethanol added to concentrate and mixed before starting). Then the container was transferred to the 4 ºC flammable fridge. I will remove one sample in 2 hours for DNA/RNA extraction, one in one week, and one in two weeks. One sample was transferred into a 2mL screw-cap vial filled with PAXgene tissue stabilizer and placed at -80 ºC after the 2 hour incubation at 4 ºC to test this storage method.

## Extraction of DNA/RNA using Zymo Quick DNA/RNA Protocol from Stabilized Samples (Time Course), March 21, 2023

### [DNA/RNA Extraction Protocol Link](https://zdellaert.github.io/ZD_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/Protocols_Zymo_Quick_DNA_RNA_Miniprep_Plus/)

Followed this [protocol](https://zdellaert.github.io/ZD_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/Protocols_Zymo_Quick_DNA_RNA_Miniprep_Plus/) exactly, but followed steps for samples preserved in RNAlater. Bead-beat for 2 minutes.

### Extraction, Day 1:

2 hours after pouring off the PAXgene fixative and replacing with PAXgene stabilizer (samples maintained at 4 ºC during this time), I removed one fragment from the PAXgene stabilizer and immediately transferred it to a 2 mL tube filled with 1 mL of DNA/RNA shield and beads and continued as described in the protocol for processing samples in RNAlater.

### Qubit Results

- Used Broad range dsDNA and RNA Qubit [Protocol](https://zdellaert.github.io/ZD_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/Qubit-Protocol/)
- All samples read twice, standard only read once

 DNA Standards: 210.45 (S1) & 24497.80 (S2)

### DNA and RNA Quality Check: Gel, using [Kristina's gel protocol at the bottom of this page.](https://zdellaert.github.io/ZD_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/Protocols_Zymo_Quick_DNA_RNA_Miniprep_Plus/)
