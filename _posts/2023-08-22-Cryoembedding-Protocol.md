# Protocol for Cryoembedding PAXgene-fixed Tissues in OCT Media for Cryosectioning (for FISH, Immunofluorescence, and LCM)

See Video from 10X genomics: [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PCj8XrpskPw&list=PLfaSRwcfHcq0D8RTy9LR8sKsWcF6C8TAt&index=3)

### The goal of this protocol is to embed tissue to create tissue sections that preserve structural integrity and maintain the integrity of RNA and proteins for downstream imaging and RNA extraction

### Therefore, all of these steps should be performed with gloves and in a clean workspace

## Supplies
1. [OCT Embedding Medium](https://www.fishersci.com/shop/products/tissue-plus-o-c-t-compound/23730571#?keyword=o.c.t%20cryo)
2. [Cryomolds](https://us.vwr.com/store/product/4639407/null)
3. Forceps
4. Dry Ice
5. Mortar and Pestle for making powdered dry ice 
    - or: small dewar of liquid nitrogen (no more than 50-100 mL needed)
6. Optional: [Sucrose](https://www.fishersci.com/shop/products/sucrose-ultrapure-99/AAJ6427022#?keyword=sucrose)


## Preparation
1. Clean bench with clean paper towels (spray solution, wipe down) in the following order:
    - 10% bleach solution
    - DI water
    - 70% ethanol
    - RNAse cleaner (spray bottle)
2. Sterilize forceps in same way
3. Cool OCT on ice (not dry ice) for at least 30 mins

4. Cool forceps on dry ice for at least 30 mins

## Input material:
1. Start with -80 ºC frozen tissue in PAXgene tissue stabilizer ([example here, full protocol coming soon](https://zdellaert.github.io/ZD_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/Paxgene-Decalcification-Sections-Test/))
    - Keep tissue at -80 or on dry ice until it is placed in embedding mold
2. If starting with tissue that has not been placed in -80 ºC yet, for example tissue that just finished decalcifying, perform "cryoprotection" by transfering from PAXgene stabilizer to a > 10mL volume of a 15% sucrose solution at 4ºC until tissue sinks then to a 30% sucrose solution at 4ºC for several hours or overnight.
    - Some protocols, such as the [PAXgene cryoembedding protocol](https://www.preanalytix.com/storage/download/_ProductResources_/SuppProtocols/PROM-8405-002_PX14_SP_Tissue_System_Cryoembedding_PFPE_tissues_1216_WW.pdf), place tissue straight into the 30% solution and incubate at 4 ºC until the tissue sinks or overnight.
    - Prepare a 15% sucrose solution [w/v] by dissolving 15 g sucrose (high purity grade) in 100 ml RNasefree water. 
    - Prepare a 30% sucrose solution [w/v] by dissolving 30 g sucrose (high purity grade) in 100 ml RNasefree water. 

## Embedding
2. Embed in -80 cooled OCT (over dry ice) + freeze at -80ºC
