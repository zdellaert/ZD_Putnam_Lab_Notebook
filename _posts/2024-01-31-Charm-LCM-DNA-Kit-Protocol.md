## Goal: to extract *high-quality* gDNA from PAXgene-fixed cryosectioned tissue.

## Materials and Equipment

- Charm Biotech Just-a-Tube ™ Laser Captured Microdissection (LCM) Sample Genomic DNA Purification [Kit](https://www.charmbiotech.com/lcm-dna.htm), [protocol](https://github.com/zdellaert/ZD_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/protocols/Charm_Biotech_LCM_DNA_Kit.pdf)
- Heating block capable of heating to 60ºC
- Centrifuge and rotor capable of spinning at 15,000 rcf
- 100% Ethanol
- Plastics: 0.2 mL PCR tube for LCM sample collection, 1-2 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes for mixing buffers, several 1000 uL, 200 uL, and 20 uL pipette tips per sample.

## First time opening kit: Reagent Preparation

- Add appropriate amount of ethanol for size of kit to Washing Buffer II (WB2).
  - For this kit, add 24 mL of ethanol to WB2.

## Sterilizing working area to maintain a clean environment

Clean bench with clean paper towels (spray solution, wipe down) in the following order:

  1. 10% bleach solution  
  2. DI water  
  3. 70% ethanol

Clean pipettes, tip boxes, and the controls on the heating block and centrifuge by squirting 70% ethanol on a paper towel and wiping them down. Wipe down gloves with 70% ethanol. Do not spray solutions directly on the equipment.

## Day of extraction (only prep amount for samples extracted that day): Reagent Preparation

- Prepare fresh working Digestion Buffer RD1 (DD1) if you use LCM samples from frozen tissue sections (if using FFPE tissue, use buffer DD2 instead).
  - Add **10 ul of Proteinase K** (provided) to each 90 ul DD1 for each LCM sample.
- (Note: Digestion Buffer 1(DDI) contains SDS, which can precipitate out of the buffer if stored at room temperature for a long time. If a precipitate is present, incubate the buffer in a 37 °C - 58 ºC water bath for 5 minutes, or until the SDS re-dissolves and the solution clears. Mix thoroughly but swirling gently.)

## Protocol Steps

1. **Sample prep from LCM samples**
   - LCM from frozen tissue sections
     - Add 100 uL of prepared buffer DD1 (see above) for LCM to the cap containing the LCM-captured cells, invert the tube and tap the cap with a finger until the solution spreads and covers the whole cap completely.
   - LCM from FFPE tissue sections
     - Add 100 uL buffer DD2
2. Incubate the inverted tube at 60 ºC for 10 minutes to allow the captured cells and tissues detaching from the cap into the digestion buffer.
3. Centrifuge briefly to collect all liquid at the bottom of the tube. Mix the liquid by pipetting up and down the solution several times to disperse any pellet precipitate.
4. Digestion with Proteinase K
  -  **LCM from frozen tissue sections**
     -  Incubate at 60 °C for 3-4 hours with occasional mixing until lysis is complete.
        -  (Optional: You may perform digestion at 52 ºC overnight if preferred).
   - **LCM from FFPE tissue sections**
     - Incubate at 94 ºC for 10 minutes, briefly spin tube to collect everything in the bottom
     - Add 10 uL proteinase K to the tube and mix well
     - Incubate at 60 °C for 3-4 hours with occasional mixing until lysis is complete.
        -  (Optional: You may perform digestion at 52 ºC overnight if preferred).
   - **At the end of incubation,no pellets should be visible**, otherwise, extend incubation 15 minutes more to make sure no pellets exist.
5. Centrifuge the microtube at maximum speed (about 13000 rpm or 16000 X g) for one minute.


### Binding DNA Products

1. **Transfer** all 100 ul cell lysate solution from the capturing tube to a Binding Tube (BT3).
2. Add **200 uL Binding Buffer (PB5)** (prepared above) to the Binding Tube (BT3). Mix well with the lysate by pipeting up and down the solution 10 times to obtain a homogenous solution.
3. Centrifuge the Binding Tube (BT3) at maximum speed (about 13000 rpm or 16000 X g) at room temperature for 5 minutes ot bind the DNA
    - (Note: During centrifugation always position the micro-tube hinge pointed outward from thecenter of rotation. Maiority of RNA will collect at the botom along the hinge side of the Binding Tube.)
4. Remove the solution from the tube
   - Decant the solution by quick flip-over the tube over a waste container and shaking briskly, then put the inverted tube on a stack of clean absorbent paper such as Kimwipe, or paper towels, then tap the tube on the clean paper to remove as much liquid as possible
   - If pipetting the liquid out instead, be sure not to scrape the walls of the tube with pipette tips during aspiration as the products are bound to the walls of the Binding Tube.

### Washing Products

1. Add **250 ul Wash Buffer II** (WB2) containing ethanol to the Binding Tube (BT3). 
   - Mix by pipetting the solution up and down 2-3 times
   - Incubate the tube for 10-30 seconds at room temperature.
2. Centrifuge the Binding Tube (BT3) at maximum speed (about 13000 rpm or 16000 X g) at room temperature for one minute. (Note: During centrifugation, always position micro-tube hinge pointed outward from the center of rotation.)
3. Remove the WB2 from the Binding Tube as above.
4. **Repeat step 1 to 3** above for a total of two washes with Washing Buffer II (WB2).
5. After the final wash, to ensure **complete removal of Washing Buffer**, spin the Binding Tube (BT3) very briefly, aspirate the last drop of liquid at the bottom of the tube with a 200 ul pipet tip, and air-dry the Binding Tube (BT3) in a lab hood for 8-10 minutes to remove any residual liquid.
   - Be sure not to scrape the walls of the tube with pipette tips during aspiration as the products are bound to the walls of the Binding Tube.

### Eluting Products

<u>Sample Elution</u>

1. Add **10-40 ul Elution Buffer** (EB1) into each tube.
2. Elution options
   1. Option #1 (Elute with vortex): Close the tube and vortex for 30 seconds. Centrifuge the tube at maximum speed briefly to collect all liguid at the bottom of each tube
   2. Option #2 (Elute with pipette): Pipette the solution up and down 5-7 times, and incubate for >60 seconds at room temperature
   3. Option #3 (Elute with shake): Close the tube and shake the tube for 5-6 minutes with a moderate-speed shaker.
3. The eluted DNA may be used immediately in downstream applications. Alternatively, the eluted DNA may be stored at 4 °C for short-term storage or -20 °C for long-term storage.
 
## Quality Control (QC)

These steps analyze the quantity and quality of the DNA extracted.

### DNA Quantity  

Follow Broad Range dsDNA Qubit [protocol](https://zdellaert.github.io/ZD_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/Qubit-Protocol/) to analyze sample **quantity**. Read standards once and record values, read all samples twice.

### DNA Quality  

If DNA quantity is sufficient (typically >10 ng/µL) follow the PPP Agarose Gel [Protocol](https://zdellaert.github.io/ZD_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/Gel-Protocol/) to determine DNA quality. "Good" DNA should form a distinct band a the very top of the gel.
