## Extracting RNA and DNA from Fixed P. acuta Sections (newly fixed 2/8/24)

Continuation from [this post](https://zdellaert.github.io/ZD_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/Testing-Charm-LCM-RNA-Kit/), and [this post](https://zdellaert.github.io/ZD_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/Continued-Testing-Charm-LCM-RNA-Kit/), in which I was able to get relatively good RNA from sectioned tissue from P. compressa and M. capitata.

### [Protocol Link](https://zdellaert.github.io/ZD_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/Charm-LCM-RNA-Kit-Protocol/)

## 02/08/24 - Fixing tissue, decalcifying, and preparing for sectioning

### Protocol [here](https://zdellaert.github.io/ZD_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/PAXgene-Fix-Decalc-Protocol/)

1. Fixing two "chunky" branches from a large BT3/4 POC colony in one 5mL container with 5.5mL of Fixative.
    - Day 1 (02/08/24): Fixed tissue in PAXgene fixative
      - sterilized, RNAse cleaned clippers and forceps used for all steps
    - **Day 2 (02/09/24): Replaced fixative with stabilizer, transferred to 4 ºC**
    - **Day 3 (02/10/24): Started decalcification, kept on shaker in cold room (4 ºC)**
    - **Day 5 (02/12/24): Decalc done after 48 hours.**
      - Tissue washed (10 mins, 1X RNAse-free PBS).
      - Transferred into Paxgene tissue stabilizer for 24 hours at 4 ºC.
2. Notes on plan with cryoprotection
   - On 2/1/24, I attempted to section a branch from [this series](https://zdellaert.github.io/ZD_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/PAXgene-Fix-Decalc/) that I embedded on 1/29/24 without sucrose cryoprotection and the sectioning failed. The tissue was melting out of the block of OCT, much like the very first time I sectioned P. acuta, which was also without a sucrose cryoprotection step.
   - Therefore, I want to test if I am able to section a newly-fixed branch without cryoprotection (not one that has been sitting in the -80 for months), but at the same time I will have a back-up, cryoprotected branch from the same colony to also test RNA and DNA extractions with if the non-sucrose branch sectioning fails.
   - Ideally, I am able to section and maintain morphology without a sucrose step as this [significantly increases RNA quality](https://zdellaert.github.io/ZD_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/PAXgene-Fix-Decalc/)
3. Embedding
   - Sucrose Branch:
     - 100mL of 1X PBS in RNAse Free H2O and keep at 4ºC for this step and following extraction steps.
     - Add 3 g sucrose + 10 mL 10 RNAse Free PBS in a 50-mL Falcon tube.
       - Place the tube on a rocker to dissolve sucrose and then keep at 4°C.
     - Perform "cryoprotection" by transfering branch from PAXgene stabilizer to the sucrose solution at 4ºC for several hours or overnight, once the tissue sinks you can continue processing.
   - Fresh Branch:
     - Leave in PAXgene stabilizer at 4ºC until other branch cryoprotection is complete.
   - Embed both branches on late afternoon 2/13/24 or morning 2/14/24 on powereded dry ice.

## 2/15/24 - Sectioning

[sectioning protocol](https://zdellaert.github.io/ZD_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/Cryosectioning-Protocol/)

"Cut sections onto slide, then air dry PEN slide at room temp for 2 minutes on dessicant ([Roy et al 2020 Bioprotocols](https://github.com/zdellaert/ZD_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/protocols/BioProtoc-10-01-3475.pdf))"

Notes from 2/1/24, update after sectioning 2/15/24:
   - Playing around with temperature, mostly sectioned at -19 ºC
   - Slides dried in cryostat for 5-10 minutes then transferred to falcon tube with silica gel packet on dry ice (2 slides back to back per tube)
   - After sectioning, transported slides to Molecular lab and proceeded with RNA extraction within 1 hour
   - Slides were kept in falcon tube with silica gel packet on dry ice 

## 2/15/24 - RNA Extraction using protocol modificiations used for [P. compressa and M. capitata](https://zdellaert.github.io/ZD_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/Continued-Testing-Charm-LCM-RNA-Kit/)

Modifications to protocol:
- Make 100 uL of lysis buffer mixture and pre-cool on ice
- Pre-cool forceps and razor blades for transferring tissue to lysis buffer
- Rinsed slide in 100% Ethanol for 30s on dry ice
  - **should be this series of steps....**
    - 2 minute in ice-cold 70% Ethanol
    - 45 s in ice-cold 50% Ethanol
    - 30 s in ice-cold 30% Ethanol
    - if there is excess OCT, dip slide in ice-cold RNAse free water 5-6 times over 1-2 mins
  - Stain and wash all slides and perform dissections in petri dish cleaned to be RNAse free
- Replaced ethanol with RNAse/DNAse-free water to rinse
- Remove slide to dark background over PCR rack (over dry ice, though be careful to not freeze the water once the volume on the slide is low, if that's freezing move to regular ice) and use sterile razor blade, cleaned with RNAse cleaner, to scrape off tissue sections into a tube filled with prepared **100 uL RD2 digestion buffer**.
  - this is double the normal RD2 amount, because I added a lot of tissue
  - honestly just used my tiny forceps this time to scoop up tissue, they were cleaned with ethanol and RNAse cleaner
- Then, I followed the protocol as written for FFPE, with a **15 minute digestion at 56 ºC (shaker-incubator, 1400 rpm)**
  - since I used double the amount of lysis buffer, I used double the amount of binding buffer (**200 uL RB7**)
  - still had some debris in the Porites tube when I transerred to the binding tube, but this seemed okay. In the future, spin down and remove any pellet before proceeding or increase digestion time.

#### Qubit Results

- Used Broad range RNA Qubit [Protocol](https://zdellaert.github.io/ZD_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/Qubit-Protocol/)
- All samples read twice, standard only read once


#### RNA Quality Check: Tapestation


## 2/16/24 - DNA Extraction, protocol [here](https://zdellaert.github.io/ZD_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/Charm-LCM-DNA-Kit-Protocol/)
