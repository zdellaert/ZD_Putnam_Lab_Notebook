## Concentrating Low-Quantity ENCORE RNA and Pooling Re-extractions Using Zymo Clean and Concentrate Kit for ENCORE Project, May 5, 2023

After finishing re-extractions for the super-low-quantity samples for the ENCORE project on [4/27/23](https://zdellaert.github.io/ZD_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/ENCORE-RNA-DNA-Re-extractions-2023-04-27/), I used the [Zymo RNA Clean and Concentrate Kit](https://www.zymoresearch.com/products/rna-clean-concentrator-5) as also used [previously for this project](https://zdellaert.github.io/ZD_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/Pooling-RNA-Clean-Concentrate-2023-03-02/).

Today I did two things:

1. Concentrated the RNA that had a concentration between the range of 7-11 ng/uL to get a concentration of at least 12.

2. Pooling re-extractions with initial extractions when the re-extractions on [4/27/23](https://zdellaert.github.io/ZD_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/ENCORE-RNA-DNA-Re-extractions-2023-04-27/) still had a concentration less than 12 ng/uL. 

## Protocol

For both of these conditions, the protocol was the same but for the pooling I just took the entire volume of the initial extraction and combined it with the entire volume of the re-extraction, then performed the Zymo protocol using the total combined volume.

Then, follow the [protocol](https://github.com/zdellaert/ZD_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/protocols/Zymo_RNA_Clean_Concentrate.pdf) **based on the volume for each tube** for the Zymo Clean and Concentrate kit, eluting in 25 µL of DNAse/RNAse free water.

For an example tube where two RNA tubes of 40 uL (initial extraction and re-extraction) are combined to make 80uL (or just an RNA tube with a volume of 80uL):

Base volume: 80 uL

1. Since each sample is **80** uL, add **160** uL (2 x **80**) of RNA binding buffer.
2. Add an equal volume (**240** uL (3 x **80**)) of 100% ethanol and mix.
3. Transfer the sample to the Zymo-Spin™ IC Column in a Collection Tube and centrifuge. Discard the flow-through.
4. Add 400 µl RNA Prep Buffer to the column and centrifuge. Discard the flow-through.
5. Add 700 µl RNA Wash Buffer to the column and centrifuge. Discard the flow-through.
6. Add 400 µl RNA Wash Buffer to the column and centrifuge for 1 minute ensure complete removal of the wash buffer. Carefully, transfer the column into a RNase-free tube (not provided).
7. Add 25 µl DNase/RNase-Free Water directly to the column matrix and centrifuge.

Example for a base volume of 90 uL:

Base volume: 90 uL

1. Since each sample is **90** uL, add **180** uL (2 x **90**) of RNA binding buffer.
2. Add an equal volume (**270** uL (3 x **90**)) of 100% ethanol and mix.
3. Transfer the sample to the Zymo-Spin™ IC Column in a Collection Tube and centrifuge. Discard the flow-through.
4. Add 400 µl RNA Prep Buffer to the column and centrifuge. Discard the flow-through.
5. Add 700 µl RNA Wash Buffer to the column and centrifuge. Discard the flow-through.
6. Add 400 µl RNA Wash Buffer to the column and centrifuge for 1 minute ensure complete removal of the wash buffer. Carefully, transfer the column into a RNase-free tube (not provided).
7. Add 25 µl DNase/RNase-Free Water directly to the column matrix and centrifuge.
