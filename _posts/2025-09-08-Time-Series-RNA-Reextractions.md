## RNA Re-extractions for Time Series Project, September 8, 2025

### Continuation of Natalie's amazing work extracting these samples, latest post [here](https://github.com/nchampney/NEC_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/_posts/2025-08-14-TimeSeries-RNA-Re-Extractions.md)

### Clean & concentrate of 2 extractions each of 4 *Montipora capitata* samples from the Time Series experiment done in June and July of 2025. These samples had less than 500 ng of total RNA and multiple extractions will be pooled to increase yield for sequencing.

### Samples

The sample IDs are MON: RO_H1, R1_H1, R3_H1, and R24_H3

- RO_H1: 70 µl from 9/5/25 + 40 µl from 8/12/25
- RO_H1: 70 µl from 9/5/25 + 40 µl from 8/29/25
- RO_H1: 70 µl from 9/5/25 + 40 µl from 8/29/25
- RO_H1: 70 µl from 9/5/25 + 40 µl from 8/12/25

## Protocol

I took the entire volume of the initial extraction and combined it with the entire volume of the re-extraction, then performed the Zymo [protocol](https://github.com/zdellaert/ZD_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/protocols/Zymo_RNA_Clean_Concentrate.pdf) using the total combined volume.

For an example tube where two RNA tubes of 40 uL (initial extraction and re-extraction) are combined to make 80uL (or just an RNA tube with a volume of 80µl):

Base volume: 80 µl

1. Since each sample is **80** uL, add **160** uL (2 x **80**) of RNA binding buffer.
2. Add an equal volume (**240** uL (3 x **80**)) of 100% ethanol and mix.
3. Transfer the sample to the Zymo-Spin™ IC Column in a Collection Tube and centrifuge. Discard the flow-through.
4. Add 400 µl RNA Prep Buffer to the column and centrifuge. Discard the flow-through.
5. Add 700 µl RNA Wash Buffer to the column and centrifuge. Discard the flow-through.
6. Add 400 µl RNA Wash Buffer to the column and centrifuge for 1 minute ensure complete removal of the wash buffer. Carefully, transfer the column into a RNase-free tube (not provided).
7. Add 16 µl DNase/RNase-Free Water directly to the column matrix, wait one minute, and centrifuge.
8. Add 16 µl DNase/RNase-Free Water directly to the column matrix, wait one minute, and centrifuge. Total elution volume 32 µl.

## Qubit Results

- Used Broad range dsDNA and RNA Qubit Protocol [HERE](https://zdellaert.github.io/ZD_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/Qubit-Protocol/) 
- All samples read twice, standard only read once
