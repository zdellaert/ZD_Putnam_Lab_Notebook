## Fixing and decalcifying 16 branches of Pocillopora tissue for testing protocols

### Protocol [here](https://github.com/zdellaert/ZD_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/_posts/2023-08-31-PAXgene-Fix-Decalc-Protocol.md)

1. Fixed 16 branches, see protocol post above for images
    - 4 per tissue casette
    - Day 1 (8/30/23): Fixed tissue in PAXgene fixative
    - Day 2 (8/31/23): Replaced fixative with stabilizer, transferred to 4 ºC
    - Day 3 (9/1/23): Started decalcification, kept on shaker in cold room (4 ºC)
    - Day 4 (9/2/23): Changed EDTA solution
    - Day 5 (9/3/23): Decalcification done, tissue washed and transferred to PAXgene stabilizer at -80 ºC
2. Planned RNA Extractions to test effects on RNA integrity at each step
   - Pre-decalc (put at -80 ºC on 9/1/23)
   - Post-decalc (put at -80 ºC on 9/3/23)
   - Pre-sucrose (XX days at -80 ºC)
   - Post-surcrose?
   - Try to extract RNA from sections after sectioning

   Weighing starting material to try to keep it consistent is a good idea.
