## How to use IGV on Unity

### Install

1. Navigate to `cd /work/pi_hputnam_uri_edu/pgrams`
2. Request interactive node usage using `salloc`
3. Navigate to the IGV download page, and right click "IGV for Linux" > "Copy Link Address..."
   1. https://igv.org/doc/desktop/#DownloadPage/
   2. https://data.broadinstitute.org/igv/projects/downloads/2.19/IGV_Linux_2.19.1_WithJava.zip
4. Download the IGV Linux application into this directory: `wget https://data.broadinstitute.org/igv/projects/downloads/2.19/IGV_Linux_2.19.1_WithJava.zip`
5. Unzip the application: `unzip IGV_Linux_2.19.1_WithJava.zip`

### Running the program
1. When ssh-ing into Unity, add `-X` to your ssh command: `ssh -X username_uri_edu`
2. Navigate to `cd /work/pi_hputnam_uri_edu/pgrams/IGV_Linux_2.19.1/`
3. "To run an application on the cluster that uses a GUI, you must use an interactive job, in addition to the --x11 argument": `salloc -c 6 -p cpu --x11`
4. Run program by `./igv.sh`
   1. I had some issues with how XQuartz was rendering the window for me, so I had to run this:

```
export _JAVA_OPTIONS='-Dsun.java2d.uiScale=1.0 -Dsun.java2d.xrender=false -Dsun.java2d.opengl=false'
export LIBGL_ALWAYS_INDIRECT=1
./igv.sh
```

### Notes

It's still kinda slow. Which almost defeats the purpose, but allows for viewing bam files without having to download them.
