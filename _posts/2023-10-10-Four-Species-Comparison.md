## Fixing and decalcifying fragments from four species from CBLS wetlab

### *Montipora capitata, Porites compressa* (both collected from HI in October 2023), *Pocillopora acuta,* and *Seriatopora sp.* (both from Ocean State Aquatics, long-term residents in CBLS wetlab)

### Protocol [here](https://zdellaert.github.io/ZD_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/PAXgene-Fix-Decalc-Protocol/)

1. Fixing in two PAXgene containers for good tissue:fixative ratio, fragments do not need to be separated because we are not using these for downstream molecular work, just morphology.
    - Day 1 (10/10/23): Fixed tissue in PAXgene fixative
    - Day 2 (10/11/23): Replaced fixative with stabilizer, transferred to 4 ºC
    - Day 3 (10/12/23): Started decalcification, kept on shaker in cold room (4 ºC)
    - Day 4 (10/13/23): Changed EDTA solution
    - Day 5 (10/14/23): Changed EDTA solution
    - Day 6 (10/15/23): Changed EDTA solution
    - Day 7 (10/16/23): Decalc still not done for Porites or Montipora! Changed EDTA solution for these two and removed the POC and SER branches into PBS @ 4ºC. 
    - Day 8 (10/17/23):
    - Day 9 (10/18/23):
    - Day 10 (10/19/23):


    - **to do** : Decalcification done, tissue washed (10 mins, 1X PBS) and split each tissue piece into two fragments
        - one goes to sucrose for [cryoprotection and embedding](https://zdellaert.github.io/ZD_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/Cryoembedding-Protocol/) for [cryosectioning](https://zdellaert.github.io/ZD_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/Cryosectioning-Protocol/)
        - one substantial "tunic" will be transferred to 1X PBS (or paxgene stabilizer??) for confocal imaging as seen in [Yost et al. 2013](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0944200613000640)
            - From Yost et al. methods: "2.2. Microscopy Sub-fragments (approximately 1–2 cm2) of each coral were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 1 h and then de-calcified in 10% HCl until the tissue tunics (intact biological tissues) were skeleton-free. **The tissue tunics were stored in 1× PBS at 4 ◦C in the dark.** Decalcified tissue tunics were bisected with a scalpel and visualized using confocal microscopy."

All corals in decalcification (we are not using these for RNA so we can keep them in the same container):

Microscopy methods from Yost et al. methods: "Samples were scanned with excitations of violet (405 nm) and green (498 nm and 543 nm) light, and emissions were collected at 450 nm to visualize host tissues and at 600 nm to visualize autofluorescence of Symbiodinium. Measurements of tissue thickness were taken in triplicate at random locations on each tissue sample to determine a colony average. Coral tissue thickness was characterized by either (i) high biomass, thick tissues anastomosing through highly perforate skeletons of perforate corals or (ii) low biomass, thin tissue ‘veneers’ of imperforate corals. Thus, tissue thickness did not appear to be altered by water absorption mechanisms (e.g., in the gastrovascular cavity) that may alter tissue thickness."
