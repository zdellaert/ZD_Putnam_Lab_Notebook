## E5 Time Series RNA and DNA Re-Extractions, August 1, 2024

### [Protocol Link](https://zdellaert.github.io/ZD_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/Protocols_Zymo_Quick_DNA_RNA_Miniprep_Plus/)

### Extraction of 8 POC, POR, and ACR samples from Moorea from the E5 Time Series (Time Points 1-4, sampled January-November 2020)

## Samples

## Protocol

- We will clip them following [this protocol](https://emmastrand.github.io/EmmaStrand_Notebook/KBay-Coral-Chipping-2021/) into 2.0 screw cap tubes with 1000 uL of DNA/RNA shield and 0.25 mL of 0.5mm glass beads. These were kept on dry ice during clipping and immediately put into the -80 ºC freezer.

- On extraction day, follow [protocol](https://zdellaert.github.io/ZD_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/Protocols_Zymo_Quick_DNA_RNA_Miniprep_Plus/) with adjustments:
    1. Bead beat for 1-1.5 minutes on the vortex at max speed. I started off with one minute for all samples but added a minute of bead-beating for samples if the liquid still looked very light-colored after one minute of homogenization.
    2. Briefly spin down and remove 400 uL of supernatant into a clean tube. Spin for 3 mins at 9,000 rcf.
    3. Put original samples and bead tubes back in -80 ºC freezer.
    4. Remove 300 uL of the supernatant into a new tube and continue on with the protocol below (from the Pro K step) as written.

- Other than the adjustments mentioned above, I followed [protocol](https://zdellaert.github.io/ZD_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/Protocols_Zymo_Quick_DNA_RNA_Miniprep_Plus/) exactly.
