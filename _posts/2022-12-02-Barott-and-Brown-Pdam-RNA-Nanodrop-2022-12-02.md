## QC of RNA for Brown/Barott Pdam Project, December 2, 2022

Nanodrop extracted RNA from the Barott and Brown Pdam extractions prior to sending the extracted RNA for sequencing. This is to test the purity of the extracted RNA. The blank used is the RNAse/DNAse free water included in the Zymo kit used for extracting the RNA.

### Results


### Protocol

The standard PPP Nanodrop protocol for RNA can be found [here](https://zdellaert.github.io/ZD_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/2022-10-02-Nanodrop-Protocol/).

I used the nanodrop in the Lane lab with supervision/permission from Kristina Terpis, the Technician in the Putnam and Lane labs. The protocol is the same but it only can read one sample at a time and there is no printer, so I record the values by hand.
