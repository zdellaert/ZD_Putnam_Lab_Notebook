## QC of RNA for Brown/Barott Pdam Project, December 2, 2022

Nanodrop extracted RNA from the Barott and Brown Pdam extractions prior to sending the extracted RNA for sequencing. This is to test the purity of the extracted RNA. The blank used is the RNAse/DNAse free water included in the Zymo kit used for extracting the RNA.

### Results


### Protocol

Currently the protocol is hosted [here](https://github.com/meschedl/PPP-Lab-Resources/blob/master/Protocols_and_Lab_Resources/RNA_Quality_Control/Nanodrop-RNA.md), but I will add a version to my notebook and link here soon.
