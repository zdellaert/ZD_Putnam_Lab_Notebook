## RNA and DNA Extractions for ENCORE Project, October 17, 2022

### [Protocol Link](https://zdellaert.github.io/ZD_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/Protocols_Zymo_Quick_DNA_RNA_Miniprep_Plus/)

### Extraction of 12 samples from ENCORE Project. These samples were collected in Bermuda in August 2022 for the ENCORE TPC project. There are 160 samples total from the following 4 species: *Diploria labyrinthiformis* (DLAB), *Montastraea cavernosa* (MCAV), *Madracis decactis* (MDEC), and *Porites astreoides* (PAST)

## Samples

Continuing on with the rest of the ENCORE extractions.

## Notes

- Followed [protocol](https://zdellaert.github.io/ZD_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/Protocols_Zymo_Quick_DNA_RNA_Miniprep_Plus/) exactly. Took 300 uL from the sample tubes for all species except for *Porites astreoides* (PAST). For *Porites astreoides* (PAST), I took 150 uL of the DNA/RNA shield from the sample tube and added 150 uL of clean DNA/RNA shield before proceeding with the extraction as written.

- Throughout the RNA extraction, the filters of all the PAST samples were pigmented.

- I used a new Tri-track loading dye taken from the Putnam shelf in the -20 ºC freezer in attempt to figure out the source of the banding patterns in the DNA gels. This did not get rid of the banding in the DNA. I also tried moving the gel around on different places on the imager and even turning it upside down and the ladder-like small bands still show up in the DNA lanes. Next, I will try imaging a blank gel and testing out other imagers.

## Qubit Results

- Used Broad range dsDNA and RNA Qubit [Protocol](https://zdellaert.github.io/ZD_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/Qubit-Protocol/)
- All samples read twice, standard only read once

 -- **Qubit results seem very odd, getting nds for DNA with clear bands. Maybe I need to be quicker about measuring the Qubit tubes right after making them. I poured the gel after mixing the Qubit tubes and before measuring them to get the gel running ASAP due to time constraints.**

## DNA and RNA Quality Check: Gel, using [Kristina's gel protocol at the bottom of this page.](https://zdellaert.github.io/ZD_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/Protocols_Zymo_Quick_DNA_RNA_Miniprep_Plus/)

Ran the gel for 70 minutes instead of 60 minutes, which seems to help the "smiling" patterns in the ladders in my last 2 extractions.

## Next steps

After the 10/05/22 extraction, I was going to test out the following modifications but did not due so today because I wanted to try taking 150 uL of the sample DNA/RNA shield from the PAST samples on a few more samples to try to keep the protocol as consistent across species as possible. Clearly, this did not work, so I plan on trouble-shooting the PAST extractions using the method below on Weds, 10/19/22.

*I will talk to Hollie and Kristina about next steps for the PAST samples. Currently, I am thinking of bead beating the fragments in the tube in a bead tube with fresh DNA/RNA shield following [Kevin Wong's protocol](https://kevinhwong1.github.io/KevinHWong_Notebook/20201027-DNA-RNA-Extractions-Porites-July-Bleaching-Experiment/) here:*

> Sample Preparation and Digestion
>
> 1. Add 0.25 mL of glass beads (0.5mm) and add 500 μl of RNA/DNA shield into each empty centrifuge tube.
> 2. Take samples out from -80 °C on dry ice.
> 3. Using sterile clippers, add 0.25mm of tissue into the centrifuge tube with beads and RNA/DNA shield.
> 4. Vortex at max speed for 2 minutes.
> 5. Remove 400 μl of the supernatant and transfer to a new centrifuge tube.
> 6. Centrifuge at 9000 rcf for 3 minutes.
> 7. Transfer 300 μl supernatant to a new centrifuge tube and discard the pellet.
> 8. Add 30 μl of Proteinase K digestion buffer (10:1 ratio of sample:digestion buffer), and 15 μl of Proteinase K (2:1 ratio of digestion buffer:Proteinase K) to each sample.
> 9. Vortex and spin down.
> 10. Add 345 μl of lysis buffer.
> 11. Continue with DNA and RNA extraction protocol
