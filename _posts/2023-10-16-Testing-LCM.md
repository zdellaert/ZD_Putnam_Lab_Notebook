## Testing Laser Capture Microdissection 

### Necessary supplies:
- We are using 4 µm PEN slides available [here](https://us.vwr.com/store/product/31049722/null) (see notes from Leica [here](https://www.leica-microsystems.com/science-lab/life-science/consumables-for-laser-microdissection/) and [here](https://github.com/zdellaert/ZD_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/protocols/lmdslidememo.pdf)). To test, we are using one PEN membrane (4 µm) coated glass slide (VWR #11600288) and a PEN frame slide (not available on VWR).
    - We will likely use the PEN coated glass slide for future applications. If we use lower magnification, a 2 µm thickness of PEN membrane will also likely work, and these are available RNAse free (VWR #11505189 or #11505158). 4 µm slides are the easiest to use because: "the membrane is stronger compared to the 2 µm standard which allows easier section mounting and a lower risk of membrane injury during the mounting procedure and the membrane itself is heavier and thus easier to collect via gravity".
    - The frame slides are recommended for single-cell and other high-magnification (150X) applications.
    - If we are having issues with PEN membrane autofluorescense, we can try to switch to PPS or PET slides.

### Preparing slides for LCM
- Making the slides RNAse free (from [this memo](https://github.com/zdellaert/ZD_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/protocols/lmdslidememo.pdf)):
    - "The foil slides can be treated to remove RNases by dipping them into a bath of pure RNase Zap (Ambion Corp) for 15 seconds. Follow this with two rinses in DEPC water to remove all of the RNase Zap. The slides then should be completely dried by placing them in a heater at 37 deg C for as long as is required to dry. Then one may follow with UV treatment as described below."
        - "Note: Heating in an autoclave may not always ensure that all RNases are destroyed. If this method is performed the heating must ba at 180 deg C for up to 4 hours."
- Preparing the slide with UV Irradiation (from [this memo](https://github.com/zdellaert/ZD_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/protocols/lmdslidememo.pdf)):
    - "Prior to placing specimens on the membrane slides, it is advisable to prepare the membrane by placing the blank slides to be used, into a UV Cross-linker device. The slides should be irradiated at 220nm to 260nm at full power for 30 minutes. This will usually destroy RNases, improve the laser cutting of the foil (reducing static), and help make the foil more hydrophilic to improve adherence of the specimen."
- Then [cryosection!!](https://github.com/zdellaert/ZD_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/blob/4c37b61755cfaea5c9378dbe929cf6070dacacc1/_posts/2023-08-31-Cryosectioning-Protocol.md)
