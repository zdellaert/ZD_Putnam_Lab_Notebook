## RNA and DNA Extractions for ENCORE Project, October 31, 2022

### [Protocol Link](https://zdellaert.github.io/ZD_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/Protocols_Zymo_Quick_DNA_RNA_Miniprep_Plus/)

### Extraction of 2 samples from ENCORE Project. These samples were collected in Bermuda in August 2022 for the ENCORE TPC project. There are 160 samples total from the following 4 species: *Diploria labyrinthiformis* (DLAB), *Montastraea cavernosa* (MCAV), *Madracis decactis* (MDEC), and *Porites astreoides* (PAST)

## Samples

Forgot to take pictures, but samples were Past-C3 and Past-E3.

## Notes


## Qubit Results

- Used Broad range dsDNA and RNA Qubit [Protocol](https://meschedl.github.io/MESPutnam_Open_Lab_Notebook/Qubit-Protocol/)
- All samples read twice, standard only read once

 DNA Standards: 195.90 (S1) & 22394.56 (S2)

## DNA and RNA Quality Check: Gel, using [Kristina's gel protocol at the bottom of this page.](https://zdellaert.github.io/ZD_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/Protocols_Zymo_Quick_DNA_RNA_Miniprep_Plus/)

## Next steps

Taking a step back from *Porites* extractions for a bit. We need to brainstorm if we should try a new kit or just leave these behind for now.
