## Fixing and decalcifying Pocillopora tissue for LCM, second test before summer experiments

### Protocol [here](https://zdellaert.github.io/ZD_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/PAXgene-Fix-Decalc-Protocol/)

### Sectioning and performing LCM on the second branch that was prepared on [4/29/24](https://zdellaert.github.io/ZD_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/LCM-Sample-Prep/)

Modifying sectioning protocol to fix tissue to slides immediately after sectioning, following the PAXgene suggestions [here](https://github.com/zdellaert/ZD_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/protocols/HB-1543-S01-001_PX20_SP_TIssue_System_Preparation_of_sections_from_PFPE_and_PFCE_tissues_for_manual_or_LMD_1015_WW.pdf)

***Modified Cresyl violet staining solution*** (from [here](https://github.com/zdellaert/ZD_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/protocols/leicalmdprotocolguide-May-2015.pdf))
1. Prepare Cresyl violet staining solution at least one week prior usage
2. Add 0.5 g Cresyl violet into 50 ml 100% ethanol
3. Mix solution and store at 4°C sealed air-tight and dark

4. Day 1 (6/X/24): [Section](https://zdellaert.github.io/ZD_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/Cryosectioning-Protocol/) onto PEN membrane slide for LCM as well as extra slides for confocal morpholgy imaging and backup for RNA and DNA extraction
   1. **All surfaces and equipment should be treated with RNAse cleaner!!!**
   2. Morning of: prepare PEN slide with UV and RNAse cleaner
      1. Make sure to not damage or touch the membrane in any way
      2. Using sterilized and RNAse zap-ped forceps, dip slides in RNAse zap for 15 seconds
      3. Follow this by two 15 second rinses in DEPC water
      4. Let dry, at room temperature or at 37 ºC
      5. When visibly dry, place in UV box for 30 minutes (ideally do so immediately prior to sectioning)
      6. With clean, gloved hands, transfer to slide box for sectioning
   3. Prepare solutions:
      1. 70% Ethanol, 2 containers
      2. 100% Ethanol 
   4. **Sectioning procedure:**
      1. Keep slide cold in the cryostat, briefly warm sections with finger to adhere
      2. Air-dry the slide for 1 min at room temperature (15–25°C).
      3. 70% Ethanol, 1 minute (**some protocols say 2 min**)
      4. Transfer the slide to ice-cold 100% ethanol for transport to lab
   5. **In lab: Staining Procedure** (modified/combined from [here](https://github.com/zdellaert/ZD_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/protocols/leicalmdprotocolguide-May-2015.pdf) and [here](https://github.com/zdellaert/ZD_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/protocols/Zeiss-RNA-extraction-frozen-sections.pdf) to reduce exposure to aqueous solutions of lower than 70% ethanol to reduce RNAses) ([ALSO](https://www.olivelab.org/uploads/6/3/6/2/6362060/laser_capture_microdissection_on_frozen_sections_for_extraction_of_high-quality_nucleic_acids.pdf))
      1. **ALL SOLUTIONS ICE COLD**
         1. Place slide on petri dish
         2. Apply Cresyl violet staining solution (in 100% ethanol) directly with syringe and sterile filter to the section and incubate for 1 minute, swivel gently
         3. Dip for 5 seconds in 70% ethanol (dip several times to remove all OCT) 
            1. Repeat with fresh container of 70% ethanol
         4. Dip for 5 seconds in 100% ethanol (dip a few times) 
            1. Can fix up to 2 minutes in 100% ethanol or even for short-term storage prior to LCM
         5. Air dry sample 1-2 in drying chamber with desiccant or fume hood
            1. **if possible, proceed to immediate LCM at this step!**
   6. Freeze slides at -80 ºC
5. Day 2 (5/8/24)
   1. Morning of LCM, bring slide up to room temperature, slowly to avoid formation of water condensation inside the container
       - Thaw frozen slides at 4°C for 30 min.
       - 15 minutes at room temp in dessicator
         - Air dry, covered to prevent dust from accumulating
    2. LCM ! 
       1. If possible, resuspend cells in lysis buffer with BME immediately after collection, let lyse at RT for X mins before putting on dry ice and putting at -80 ºC
