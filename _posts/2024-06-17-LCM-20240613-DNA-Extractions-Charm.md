## Testing Charm DNA Kit on LCM Samples

### [Protocol Link](https://zdellaert.github.io/ZD_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/Charm-LCM-DNA-Kit-Protocol/)

## 6/17/24 - Extracting DNA from LCM-captured cells (LCM date 6/13/24)

Used Charm Biotech Just-a-Tube ™ Laser Captured Microdissection (LCM) Sample Total DNA Purification [Kit](https://www.charmbiotech.com/lcm-rna.htm), [protocol](https://github.com/zdellaert/ZD_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/protocols/Charm_Biotech_LCM_DNA_Kit.pdf)

### Sectioning performed on 6/12/24 and LCM on 6/13/24. See details [here](https://zdellaert.github.io/ZD_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/LCM-Test-2/) 

#### Protocol notes:

- Followed the Charm FFPE and Frozen tissue protocols almost exactly, but did all incubations at 56 ºC based on other Paxgene extraction protocols. Skipped the 94ºC incubation before the addition of ProK. Incubated in incubator genie (post pro K addition) for 2 hours. Then transferred lysate to new tube and spun down at 16000 rcf for one minute before moving supernatant into the supplied binding tube.
- Tube 10 was captured in 40 uL DD2 buffer (FFPE protocol)
- Tube 14 was captured in 40 uL DD1 buffer (Frozen Tissue protocol)
- Eluted in 15 uL of elution buffer and shook at 500 rpm for 5 minutes
  
#### Qubit Results

- Used High Sensitivity DNA Qubit [Protocol](https://zdellaert.github.io/ZD_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/Qubit-Protocol/)
- All samples read twice, standard only read once

 DNA Standards: 64.64 (S1) & 23642.49 (S2)

| colony_id | DNA_QBIT_1 | DNA_QBIT_2 | DNA_QBIT_AVG |
|-----------|------------|------------|--------------|
| LCM sample #10  |  0.701 |  0.697   |  0.699 ng/uL |
| LCM sample #14  |  0.209 |  0.206   |  0.208 ng/uL | <-- I find this odd since there was a huge visible pellet for this tube during the extraction

Could have possibly overdried the pellets....

#### DNA Quality Check: Tapestation

Womp womp. Nothing. Maybe some smudges?
