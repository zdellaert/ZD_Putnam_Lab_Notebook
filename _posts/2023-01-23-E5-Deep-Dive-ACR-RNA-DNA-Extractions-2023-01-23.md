## RNA and DNA Extractions for Brown/Barott Pdam Project, January 23, 2023

### [Protocol Link](https://zdellaert.github.io/ZD_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/Protocols_Zymo_Quick_DNA_RNA_Miniprep_Plus/)

### Extraction of 18 ACR samples from Moorea from the E5 Time Series (Time Points 1 & 4, sampled January and November 2020)

## Notes

- I located these flash frozen samples on January 18 and clipped them following [this protocol](https://emmastrand.github.io/EmmaStrand_Notebook/KBay-Coral-Chipping-2021/) into 2.0 screw cap tubes with 1000 uL of DNA/RNA shield and 0.25 mL of 0.5mm glass beads. These were kept on dry ice during clipping and immediately put into the -80 ºC freezer.

- On extraction day, I did the following steps (homogenization very similar to how it is detailed in the [protocol](https://zdellaert.github.io/ZD_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/Protocols_Zymo_Quick_DNA_RNA_Miniprep_Plus/):
    1. Bead beat for 1-1.5 minutes on the vortex at max speed. I started off with one minute for all samples but added a minute of bead-beating for samples if the liquid still looked very light-colored after one minute of homogenization.
    2. Briefly spin down and remove 400 uL of supernatant into a clean tube. Spin for 3 mins at 9,000 rcf.
    3. Put original samples and bead tubes back in -80 ºC freezer.
    4. Remove 300 uL of the supernatant into a new tube and continue on with the protocol below (from the Pro K step) as written.

- Other than the adjustments mentioned above, I followed [protocol](https://zdellaert.github.io/ZD_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/Protocols_Zymo_Quick_DNA_RNA_Miniprep_Plus/) exactly.

## Qubit Results

- Used Broad range dsDNA and RNA Qubit [Protocol](https://zdellaert.github.io/ZD_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/Qubit-Protocol/)
- All samples read twice, standard only read once

**Samples ACR-228 TP1 and ACR-234 TP1 were pale and were bead-beat for an extra 30 seconds to remove any last tissue. They had less tissue in the tubes than some of the other samples.

 DNA Standards:   (S1) &   (S2)


 RNA Standards:  (S1) & (S2)



## DNA and RNA Quality Check: Gel, using [Kristina's gel protocol at the bottom of this page.](https://zdellaert.github.io/ZD_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/Protocols_Zymo_Quick_DNA_RNA_Miniprep_Plus/)

## Next steps

Will re-extract the following samples:
